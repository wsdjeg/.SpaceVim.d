NAME
       vifm - vi file manager

SYNOPSIS
       vifm [OPTION]...
       vifm [OPTION]... path
       vifm [OPTION]... path path

DESCRIPTION
       Vifm is an ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings.	If you
       use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files	 with-
       out having to learn a new set of commands.

OPTIONS
       vifm  starts  in	 the  current directory unless it is given a different
       directory on the command line or 'vifminfo' option includes  "savedirs"
       (in which case last visited directories are used as defaults).

       -      Read list of files from standard input stream and compose custom
	      view out of them (see "Custom views" section).  Current  working
	      directory is used as a base for relative paths.

       <path> Starts Vifm in the specified path.

       <path> <path>
	      Starts Vifm in the specified paths.

       Specifying  two	directories  triggers split view even when vifm was in
       single-view mode on finishing previous session.	To suppress  this  be-
       haviour :only command can be put in the vifmrc file.

       When only one path argument is found on command-line, the left/top pane
       is automatically set as the current view.

       Paths to files are also allowed in case you want	 vifm  to  start  with
       some archive opened.

       --select <path>
	      Open  parent  directory  of  the given path and select specified
	      file in it.

       -f     Makes  vifm  instead  of	opening	 files	write	selection   to
	      $VIFM/vimfiles and quit.

       --choose-files <path>|-
	      Sets  output  file  to  write  selection into on exit instead of
	      opening files.  "-" means standard output.  Use empty  value  to
	      disable it.

       --choose-dir <path>|-
	      Sets  output  file to write last visited directory into on exit.
	      "-" means standard output.  Use empty value to disable it.

       --delimiter <delimiter>
	      Sets separator for list of  file	paths  written	out  by	 vifm.
	      Empty  value  means null character.  Default is new line charac-
	      ter.

       --on-choose <command>
	      Sets command to be executed on selected files instead of opening
	      them.   The  command may use any of macros described in "Command
	      macros" section below.  The command is executed once  for	 whole
	      selection.

       --logging[=<startup log path>]
	      Log some operational details $VIFM/log.  If the optional startup
	      log path is specified and permissions allow to open it for writ-
	      ing, then logging of early initialization (before value of $VIFM
	      is determined) is put there.

       --server-list
	      List available server names and exit.

       --server-name <name>
	      Name of target or this instance (sequential numbers are appended
	      on name conflict).

       --remote
	      Sends the rest of command line to the active vifm server (one of
	      already running instances if any).  When	there  is  no  server,
	      quits  silently.	There is no limit on how many arguments can be
	      processed.  One can combine --remote with -c <command> or +<com-
	      mand>  to	 execute  command in already running instance of vifm.
	      See also "Client-Server" section below.

       -c <command> or +<command>
	      Run command-line mode <command> on startup.   Commands  in  such
	      arguments are executed in the order they appear in command line.
	      Commands with spaces or special symbols must be enclosed in dou-
	      ble  or  single  quotes or all special symbols should be escaped
	      (the exact syntax strongly depends on shell).

       --help, -h
	      Show a brief command summary and exit vifm.

       --version, -v
	      Show version information and quit.

       --no-configs
	      Skip reading vifmrc and vifminfo.


       See "Startup" section below for the explanations on $VIFM.

General keys
       Ctrl-C or Escape
	      cancel most operations (see "Cancellation" section below), clear
	      all selected files.

       Ctrl-L clear and redraw the screen.

Basic Movement
       The basic vi key bindings are used to move through the files and pop-up
       windows.

       k, gk, or Ctrl-P
	      move cursor up one line.

       j, gj or Ctrl-N
	      move cursor down one line.

       h      when 'lsview' is off move up one directory, otherwise move  left
	      one file.

       l      when  'lsview'  is off move into a directory or launches a file,
	      otherwise move right one file.

       gg     move to the first line of the file list.

       G      move to the last line in the file list.

       gh     go up one directory.

       gl or Enter
	      enter directory or launch a file.

       H      move to the first file in the window.

       M      move to the file in the middle of the window.

       L      move to the last file in the window.

       Ctrl-F or Page Down
	      move forward one page.

       Ctrl-B or Page Up
	      move back one page.

       Ctrl-D jump back one half page.

       Ctrl-U jump forward one half page.

       n%     move to the file that is n percent from the top of the list (for
	      example 25%).

       0 or ^ move  cursor  to the first column.  See 'lsview' option descrip-
	      tion.

       $      move cursor to the last column.  See  'lsview'  option  descrip-
	      tion.

       Space  switch file lists.

Movement with Count
       Most  movement  commands	 also  accept  a count, 12j would move down 12
       files.

       [count]%
	      move to percent of the file list.

       [count]j
	      move down [count] files.

       [count]k
	      move up [count] files.

       [count]G or [count]gg
	      move to list position [count].

       [count]h
	      go up [count] directories.

Scrolling panes
       zt     redraw pane with file in top of list.

       zz     redraw pane with file in center of list.

       zb     redraw pane with file in bottom of list.

       Ctrl-E scroll pane one line down.

       Ctrl-Y scroll pane one line up.

Pane manipulation
       Second character can be entered with or without Control key.

       Ctrl-W H
	      move the pane to the far left.

       Ctrl-W J
	      move the pane to the very bottom.

       Ctrl-W K
	      move the pane to the very top.

       Ctrl-W L
	      move the pane to the far right.


       Ctrl-W h
	      switch to the left pane.

       Ctrl-W j
	      switch to the pane below.

       Ctrl-W k
	      switch to the pane above.

       Ctrl-W l
	      switch to the right pane.


       Ctrl-W b
	      switch to bottom-right window.

       Ctrl-W t
	      switch to top-left window.


       Ctrl-W p
	      switch to previous window.

       Ctrl-W w
	      switch to other pane.


       Ctrl-W o
	      leave only one pane.

       Ctrl-W s
	      split window horizontally.

       Ctrl-W v
	      split window vertically.


       Ctrl-W x
	      exchange panes.

       Ctrl-W z
	      quit preview pane or view modes.


       Ctrl-W -
	      decrease size of the view by count.

       Ctrl-W +
	      increase size of the view by count.

       Ctrl-W <
	      decrease size of the view by count.

       Ctrl-W >
	      increase size of the view by count.


       Ctrl-W |
	      set current view size to count.

       Ctrl-W _
	      set current view size to count.

       Ctrl-W =
	      make size of two views equal.

       For Ctrl-W +, Ctrl-W -, Ctrl-W <, Ctrl-W >, Ctrl-W | and Ctrl-W _  com-
       mands  count  can  be  given before and/or after Ctrl-W.	 The resulting
       count is a multiplication of those two.	So "2 Ctrl-W  2	 -"  decreases
       window size by 4 lines or columns.

       Ctrl-W | and Ctrl-W _ maximise current view by default.

Marks
       Marks are set the same way as they are in vi.

       You can use this characters for marks [a-z][A-Z][0-9].

       m[a-z][A-Z][0-9]
	      set a mark for the file at the current cursor position.

       '[a-z][A-Z][0-9]
	      navigate to the file set for the mark.


       There are also several special marks that can't be set manually:

	 - '  (single  quote) - previously visited directory of the view, thus
	   hitting '' allows switching between two last locations

	 - < - the first file of the last visually selected block

	 - > - the last file of the last visually selected block

Searching
       /regular expression pattern
	      search for files matching regular expression in  forward	direc-
	      tion and advance cursor to next match.

       /      perform forward search with top item of search pattern history.

       ?regular expression pattern
	      search  for files matching regular expression in backward direc-
	      tion and advance cursor to previous match.

       ?      perform backward search with top item of search pattern history.

       Matches are automatically selected  if  'hlsearch'  is  set.   Enabling
       'incsearch'  makes  search  interactive.	  'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'
       options affect case sensitivity of search queries.


       [count]n
	      go to the next file matching last search	pattern.   Takes  last
	      search direction into account.

       [count]N
	      go  to  the  previous  file matching last search pattern.	 Takes
	      last search direction into account.

       If 'hlsearch' option is set, hitting n/N to perform search  and	go  to
       the first matching item resets current selection in normal mode.	 It is
       not the case if search was already performed on files in the directory,
       thus  selection	is  not reset after clearing selection with escape key
       and hitting n/N key again.

       Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions for / and ?.


       [count]f[character]
	      search forward for file with [character] as first	 character  in
	      name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

       [count]F[character]
	      search  backward for file with [character] as first character in
	      name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

       [count];
	      find the next match of f or F.

       [count],
	      find the previous match of f or F.

       Note: f, F, ; and , wrap around list beginning and end  when  they  are
       used alone and they don't wrap when they are used as selectors.

File Filters
       There are three basic file filters:

	 - dot files filter (excluding "." and ".." special directories, which
	   appearance is controlled by the 'dotdirs' option);

	 - manual filter for file names;

	 - automatic filter for file names;

	 - local filter for file names (see description of the "=" normal mode
	   command).

       Performing  operations  on  manual  filter for file names automatically
       does the same on automatic one.	The  file  name	 filter	 is  separated
       mainly for convenience purpose and to get more deterministic behaviour.

       The basic vim folding key bindings are used for filtering files.

       Each file list has its own copy of each filter.

       Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.

       Files  and  directories	are  filtered separately.  For this a slash is
       appended to a directory name before testing whether it matches the fil-
       ter.  Examples:


	 " filter directories which names end with '.files'
	 :filter /^.*\.files\/$/

	 " filter files which names end with '.d'
	 :filter /^.*\.d$/

	 " filter files and directories which names end with '.o'
	 :filter /^.*\.o\/?$/

       za     toggle visibility of dot files.

       zo     show dot files.

       zm     hide dot files.

       zf     add selected files to file name filter.

       zO     show files hidden by file name filter.

       zM     restore all filters.

       zR     remove all filters.

       zr     remove local filter.

       zd     exclude  selection or current file from custom view.  Does noth-
	      ing for regular view.

       =regular expression pattern
	      filter out files that don't match regular	 expression.   Whether
	      view  is updated as regular expression is changed depends on the
	      value of the 'incsearch' option.	This kind of filter  is	 auto-
	      matically reset when directory is changed.

Other Normal Mode Keys
       [count]:
	      enter command line mode.	[count] generates range.

       q:     open  external  editor  to prompt for command-line command.  See
	      "Command line editing" section for details.

       q/     open external editor to prompt for search pattern to be searched
	      in  forward  direction.	See "Command line editing" section for
	      details.

       q?     open external editor to prompt for search pattern to be searched
	      in  backward  direction.	See "Command line editing" section for
	      details.

       q=     open external editor to prompt for filter pattern.  See "Command
	      line  editing"  section for details.  Unlike other q{x} commands
	      this one doesn't work in Visual mode.

       [count]!! and [count]!<selector>
	      enter command line mode with entered ! command.	[count]	 modi-
	      fies range.

       Ctrl-O go  backwards through directory history of current view.	Nonex-
	      istent directories are automatically skipped.

       Ctrl-I if 'cpoptions' contains "t" flag, <tab> and <c-i> switch	active
	      pane  just  like <space> does, otherwise it goes forward through
	      directory history of current view.  Nonexistent directories  are
	      automatically skipped.

       Ctrl-G create  a	 window showing detailed information about the current
	      file.

       Shift-Tab
	      enters view mode (works only after  activating  view  pane  with
	      :view command).

       ga     calculate directory size.	 Uses cached directory sizes when pos-
	      sible for better performance.

       gA     like ga, but force update.   Ignores  old	 values	 of  directory
	      sizes.

       If file under cursor is selected, each selected item is processed, oth-
       erwise only current file is updated.

       gf     find link destination (like l with 'followlinks' off,  but  also
	      finds directories).

       gr     only for MS-Windows
	      same  as	l  key,	 but  tries to run program with administrative
	      privileges.

       av     go to visual mode into selection amending state preserving  cur-
	      rent selection.

       gv     go to visual mode restoring last selection.

       gs     restore last t selection, like gv for visual mode selection.

       gu<selector>
	      make names of selected files lowercase.

       [count]guu and [count]gugu
	      make names of [count] files starting from the current one lower-
	      case.  Without [count] only current file is affected.

       gU<selector>
	      make names of selected files uppercase.

       [count]gUU and [count]gUgU
	      make names of [count] files starting from the current one upper-
	      case.  Without [count] only current file is affected.

       e      explore file in the current pane.

       i      handle  file (even if it's an executable and 'runexec' option is
	      set).

       cw     change word is used to rename a file or files.

       cW     change WORD is used to change only name of file (without	exten-
	      sion).

       cl     change link target.

       co     only for *nix
	      change file owner.

       cg     only for *nix
	      change file group.

       cp     change  file  attributes	(permission  on *nix and properties on
	      Windows).

       [count]C
	      clone file [count] times.

       [count]dd or d[count]selector
	      move selected file or  files  to	trash  directory  (if  'trash'
	      option is set, otherwise delete).	 See "Trash directory" section
	      below.

       [count]DD or D[count]selector
	      like dd and d<selector>, but omitting trash directory (even when
	      'trash' option is set).

       Y, [count]yy or y[count]selector
	      yank selected files.

       p      copy  yanked files to the current directory or move the files to
	      the current directory if they were deleted with dd or  :d[elete]
	      or  if  the  files were yanked from trash directory.  See "Trash
	      directory" section below.

       P      move the last yanked files.  The advantage of using P instead of
	      d	 followed  by  p  is that P moves files only once.  This isn't
	      important in case you're moving files in the  same  file	system
	      where  your home directory is, but using P to move files on some
	      other file system (or file systems, in case  you	want  to  move
	      files  from  fs1	to  fs2 and your home is on fs3) can save your
	      time.

       al     put symbolic links with absolute paths.

       rl     put symbolic links with relative paths.

       t      select or unselect (tag) the current file.

       u      undo last change.

       Ctrl-R redo last change.

       v or V enter visual mode, clears current selection.

       [count]Ctrl-A
	      increment first number in file name by [count] (1 by default).

       [count]Ctrl-X
	      decrement first number in file name by [count] (1 by default).

       ZQ     same as :quit!.

       ZZ     same as :quit.

       .      repeat last command-line command (not normal  mode  command)  of
	      this  session (does nothing right after startup or :restart com-
	      mand).  The command doesn't depend on command-line  history  and
	      can be used with completely disabled history.

       (      goto previous group.  Groups are defined by primary sorting key.
	      For name and iname members of each group have same first letter,
	      for all other sorting keys vifm uses size, uid, ...

       )      goto next group.	See ( key description above.

Using Count
       You can use count with commands like yy.

       [count]yy
	      yank count files starting from current cursor position downward.

       Or you can use count with motions passed to y, d or D.

       d[count]j
	      delete  (count  + 1) files starting from current cursor position
	      upward.

Registers
       vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list  of	yanked
       or deleted files.

       Registers should be specified by hitting double quote key followed by a
       register name.  Count is specified after	 register  name.   By  default
       commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

       Though  all  commands  accept  registers, most of commands ignores them
       (for example H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or	append
       new files to it.

       Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

       As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
       default register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and  A-
       Z)  unnamed  register  is  updated to contain same list of files as the
       last used register.

       _ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list  is
       always empty.

       Registers  with names from a to z and from A to Z are named ones.  Low-
       ercase registers are cleared before adding new files,  while  uppercase
       aren't and should be used to append new files to the existing file list
       of appropriate lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

       Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files	 under
       trash directory (see "Trash directory" section below).

       Registers do not contain one file more than once.

       Example:

	 "a2yy

       puts names of two files to register a (and to the unnamed register),

	 "Ad

       removes	one file and append its name to register a (and to the unnamed
       register),

	 p or "ap or "Ap

       inserts previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.

Selectors
       y, d, D, !, gu and gU commands accept selectors.	 You can combine  them
       with any of selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.

       Most  of	 selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %, f, F,
       ;, comma, ', ^, 0 and $.	 But there are some additional ones.

       a      all files in current view.

       s      selected files.

       S      all files except selected.

       Examples:

	 - dj - delete file under cursor and one below;

	 - d2j - delete file under cursor and two below;

	 - y6gg - yank all files from cursor position to 6th file in the list.

       When you pass a count to whole command and its selector they are multi-
       plied. So:

	 - 2d2j - delete file under cursor and four below;

	 - 2dj - delete file under cursor and two below;

	 - 2y6gg  -  yank  all	files from cursor position to 12th file in the
	   list.

Visual Mode
       Visual mode has to generic operating submodes:

	 - plain selection as it is in Vim;

	 - selection editing submode.

       Both modes select files in range from cursor position at	 which	visual
       mode  was  entered to current cursor position (let's call it "selection
       region").  Each of two borders can be adjusted by swapping them via "o"
       or  "O"	keys  and  updating cursor position with regular cursor motion
       keys.  Obviously, once initial cursor position  is  altered  this  way,
       real start position becomes unavailable.

       Plain  Vim-like visual mode starts with cleared selection, which is not
       restored on rejecting selection ("Escape", "Ctrl-C", "v",  "V").	  Con-
       trary  to it, selection editing doesn't clear previously selected files
       and restores them after reject.	Accepting selection by	performing  an
       operation on selected items (e.g. yanking them via "y") moves cursor to
       the top of current selection region (not to the top most selected  file
       of the view).

       In  turn,  selection  editing  supports three types of editing (look at
       statusbar to know which one is currently active):

	 - append - amend selection by selecting elements in selection region;

	 - remove - amend  selection  by  deselecting  elements	 in  selection
	   region;

	 - invert  -  amend  selection	by  inverting selection of elements in
	   selection region.

       No matter how you activate selection editing  it	 starts	 in  "append".
       One  can switch type of operation (in the order given above) via "Ctrl-
       G" key.

       Almost all normal mode keys work in visual mode, but instead of accept-
       ing selectors they operate on selected items.

       Enter  save selection and go back to normal mode not moving cursor.

       av     leave  visual mode if in amending mode (restores previous selec-
	      tion), otherwise switch to amending selection mode.

       gv     restore previous visual selection.

       v, V, Ctrl-C or Escape
	      leave visual mode if not in amending mode, otherwise  switch  to
	      normal visual selection.

       Ctrl-G switch  type of amending by round robin scheme: append -> remove
	      -> invert.

       :      enter command line mode.	Selection is cleared  on  leaving  the
	      mode.

       o      switch active selection bound.

       O      switch active selection bound.

       gu, u  make names of selected files lowercase.

       gU, U  make names of selected files uppercase.

View Mode
       This mode tries to imitate the less program.  List of builtin shortcuts
       can be found below.  Shortcuts can be customized using :qmap, :qnoremap
       and :qunmap command-line commands.

       Shift-Tab, Tab, q, Q, ZZ
	      return to normal mode.

       [count]e, [count]Ctrl-E, [count]j, [count]Ctrl-N, [count]Enter
	      scroll forward one line (or [count] lines).

       [count]y, [count]Ctrl-Y, [count]k, [count]Ctrl-K, [count]Ctrl-P
	      scroll backward one line (or [count] lines).

       [count]f, [count]Ctrl-F, [count]Ctrl-V, [count]Space
	      scroll forward one window (or [count] lines).

       [count]b, [count]Ctrl-B, [count]Alt-V
	      scroll backward one window (or [count] lines).

       [count]z
	      scroll forward one window (and set window to [count]).

       [count]w
	      scroll backward one window (and set window to [count]).

       [count]Alt-Space
	      scroll forward one window, but don't stop at end-of-file.

       [count]d, [count]Ctrl-D
	      scroll forward one half-window (and set half-window to [count]).

       [count]u, [count]Ctrl-U
	      scroll   backward	  one  half-window  (and  set  half-window  to
	      [count]).

       r, Ctrl-R, Ctrl-L
	      repaint screen.

       R      reload view preserving scroll position.

       F      toggle automatic forwarding.   Roughly  equivalent  to  periodic
	      file reload and scrolling to the bottom.	The behaviour is simi-
	      lar to `tail -F` or F key in less.

       [count]/pattern
	      search forward for ([count]-th) matching line.

       [count]?pattern
	      search backward for ([count]-th) matching line.

       [count]n
	      repeat previous search (for [count]-th occurrence).

       [count]N
	      repeat previous search  in  reverse  direction  (for  [count]-th
	      occurrence).

       [count]g, [count]<, [count]Alt-<
	      scroll to the first line of the file (or line [count]).

       [count]G, [count]>, [count]Alt->
	      scroll to the last line of the file (or line [count]).

       [count]p, [count]%
	      scroll to the beginning of the file (or N percent into file).

       v      invoke  an  editor  to  edit the current file being viewed.  The
	      command for editing is taken from	 the  'vicmd'/'vixcmd'	option
	      value  and  extended with middle line number prepended by a plus
	      sign and name of the current file.

       All "Ctrl-W x" keys work the same was as in Normal mode.	  Active  mode
       is  automatically  changed on navigating among windows.	When less-like
       mode activated on file preview is left using one by  "Ctrl-W  x"	 keys,
       its state is stored until another file is displayed using preview (it's
       possible to leave the mode, hide preview pane, do something else,  then
       get back to the file and show preview pane again with previously stored
       state in it).

Command line Mode
       These keys are available in all submodes of the command line mode: com-
       mand, search, prompt and filtering.

       Down,  Up, Left, Right, Home, End and Delete are extended keys and they
       are not available if  vifm  is  compiled	 with  --disable-extended-keys
       option.

       Esc, Ctrl-C
	      leave  command  line  mode,  cancels  input.  Cancelled input is
	      saved into appropriate history and can be recalled later.

       Ctrl-M, Enter
	      execute command and leave command line mode.

       Ctrl-I, Tab
	      complete command or its argument.

       Shift-Tab
	      complete in reverse order.

       Ctrl-_ stop completion and return original input.

       Ctrl-B, Left
	      move cursor to the left.

       Ctrl-F, Right
	      move cursor to the right.

       Ctrl-A, Home
	      go to line beginning.

       Ctrl-E, End
	      go to line end.

       Alt-B  go to the beginning of previous word.

       Alt-F  go to the end of next word.

       Ctrl-U remove characters from cursor position  till  the	 beginning  of
	      line.

       Ctrl-K remove characters from cursor position till the end of line.

       Ctrl-H, Backspace
	      remove character before the cursor.

       Ctrl-D, Delete
	      remove character under the cursor.

       Ctrl-W remove  characters  from	cursor	position till the beginning of
	      previous word.

       Alt-D  remove characters from cursor position  till  the	 beginning  of
	      next word.

       Ctrl-T swap the order of current and previous character and move cursor
	      forward or, if cursor past the end of line, swap	the  order  of
	      two last characters in the line.

       Alt-.  insert last part of previous command to current cursor position.
	      Each next call will insert last part of older command.

       Ctrl-G edit command-line content in external editor.  See "Command line
	      editing" section for details.

       Ctrl-N recall more recent command-line from history.

       Ctrl-P recall older command-line from history.

       Up     recall more recent command-line from history, that begins as the
	      current command-line.

       Down   recall older command-line from history, that begins as the  cur-
	      rent command-line.

       Ctrl-] trigger abbreviation expansion.

Pasting special values
       The  shortcuts listed below insert specified values into current cursor
       position.  Last key of every shortcut references value that it inserts:
	 - c - [c]urrent file
	 - d - [d]irectory path
	 - e - [e]xtension of a file name
	 - r - [r]oot part of a file name
	 - t - [t]ail part of directory path

	 - a - [a]utomatic filter
	 - m - [m]anual filter
	 - = - local filter, which is bound to "=" in normal mode

       Values related to filelist in current pane are available through Ctrl-X
       prefix,	while  values  from  the other pane have doubled Ctrl-X key as
       their prefix (doubled Ctrl-X is presumably easier to type  than	upper-
       case  letters; it's still easy to remap the keys to correspond to names
       of similar macros).

       Ctrl-X c
	      name of the current file of the active pane.

       Ctrl-X d
	      path to the current directory of the active pane.

       Ctrl-X e
	      extension of the current file of the active pane.

       Ctrl-X r
	      name root of current file of the active pane.

       Ctrl-X t
	      the last component of path  to  the  current  directory  of  the
	      active pane.

       Ctrl-X Ctrl-X c
	      name of the current file of the inactive pane.

       Ctrl-X Ctrl-X d
	      path to the current directory of the inactive pane.

       Ctrl-X Ctrl-X e
	      extension of the current file of the inactive pane.

       Ctrl-X Ctrl-X r
	      name root of current file of the inactive pane.

       Ctrl-X Ctrl-X t
	      the last component of path to the current directory of the inac-
	      tive pane.


       Ctrl-X a
	      value of automatic filter of the active pane.

       Ctrl-X m
	      value of manual filter of the active pane.

       Ctrl-X =
	      value of local filter of the active pane.


       Ctrl-X /
	      last pattern from search history.

Command line editing
       vifm provides a facility to edit several kinds of data, that is usually
       edited  in  command-line mode, in external editor (using command speci-
       fied by 'vicmd' or 'vixcmd' option).  This has at least two  advantages
       over built-in command-line mode:
	 - one can use full power of Vim to edit text;
	 - finding and reusing history entries becomes possible.

       The facility is supported by four input submodes of the command-line:
	 - command;
	 - forward search;
	 - backward search;
	 - file rename (see description of cw and cW normal mode keys).

       Editing	command-line  using external editor is activated by the Ctrl-G
       shortcut.  It's also possible to do almost the  same  from  Normal  and
       Visual modes using q:, q/ and q? commands.

       Temporary file created for the purpose of editing the line has the fol-
       lowing structure:

	 1. First line, which is either empty or contains text already entered
	    in command-line.

	 2. 2nd	 and all other lines with history items starting with the most
	    recent one.	 Altering this lines in any way won't  change  history
	    items stored by vifm.

       After  editing  application  is	finished the first line of the file is
       taken as the result of operation, when  the  application	 returns  zero
       exit  code.  If the application returns an error (see :cquit command in
       Vim), all the edits made to the file are ignored, but the initial value
       of the first line is saved in appropriate history.

More Mode
       This is the mode that appears when status bar content is so big that it
       doesn't fit on the screen.  One can identify the mode by "--  More  --"
       message at the bottom.

       The following keys are handled in this mode:


       Enter, Ctrl-J, j or Down
	      scroll one line down.

       Backspace, k or Up
	      scroll one line up.


       d      scroll one page (half of a screen) down.

       u      scroll one page (half of a screen) up.


       Space, f or PageDown
	      scroll down a screen.

       b or PageUp
	      scroll up a screen.


       G      scroll to the bottom.

       g      scroll to the top.


       q, Escape or Ctrl-C
	      quit the mode.

       :      switch to command-line mode.

Commands
       Commands are executed with :command_name<Enter>

       Commented  out  lines  should  start  with the double quote symbol ("),
       which may be preceded by whitespace characters intermixed with  colons.
       Inline  comments can be added at the end of the line after double quote
       symbol, only last line of a multi-line command can  contain  such  com-
       ment.   Not  all	 commands support inline comments as their syntax con-
       flicts with names of registers  and  fields  where  double  quotes  are
       allowed.

       Most of the commands have two forms: complete and the short one.	 Exam-
       ple:

	 :noh[lsearch]

       This means the complete command is nohlsearch, and  the	short  one  is
       noh.

       Most of command-line commands completely reset selection in the current
       view.  However, there are several exceptions:

	 - ":invert s" most likely leaves some files selected;

	 - :if and :else commands doesn't affect selection on successful  exe-
	   cution.

       '|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands
       in one line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument,  precede  it  with
       '\'.

       These  commands	see  '|'  as  part  of	their arguments even when it's
       escaped:

	   :[range]!
	   :autocmd
	   :cmap
	   :cnoremap
	   :command
	   :filetype
	   :fileviewer
	   :filextype
	   :map
	   :mmap
	   :mnoremap
	   :nmap
	   :nnoremap
	   :noremap
	   :normal
	   :qmap
	   :qnoremap
	   :vmap
	   :vnoremap
	   :wincmd
	   :windo
	   :winrun

       To be able to use another command after one of these, wrap it with  the
       :execute command.  An example:

	 if filetype('.') == 'reg' | execute '!!echo regular file' | endif

       :[count]

       :number
	      move to the file number.
	      :12 would move to the 12th file in the list.
	      :0 move to the top of the list.
	      :$ move to the bottom of the list.

       :[count]command
	      The   only  builtin  :[count]command  are	 :[count]d[elete]  and
	      :[count]y[ank].

       :d3    would delete three files starting at the current	file  position
	      moving down.

       :3d    would delete one file at the third line in the list.

       :command [args]

       :[range]!program
	      execute command via shell.  Accepts macros.

       :[range]!command &

       same  as	 above,	 but the command is run in the background using vifm's
       means.

       Programs that write to stdout like "ls" create an error message showing
       partial output of the command.

       Note the space before ampersand symbol, if you omit it, command will be
       run in the background using job control of your shell.

       Accepts macros.

						:!!

       :[range]!!command
	      same as :!, but pauses before returning.

       :!!    repeat the last command.

						:alink

       :[range]alink[!?]
	      create absolute symbolic links to files in directory of inactive
	      view.   With  "?"	 prompts for destination file names in an edi-
	      tor.  "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]alink[!] path
	      create absolute symbolic links to files in  directory  specified
	      by  the  path  (absolute	or  relative  to directory of inactive
	      view).

       :[range]alink[!] name1 name2...
	      create absolute symbolic links of files in  directory  of	 other
	      view  giving  each next link a corresponding name from the argu-
	      ment list.

						:apropos

       :apropos manpage
	      create a menu of items returned by the apropos command.  Select-
	      ing  an  item  in	 the  menu  opens  corresponding man page.  By
	      default the command relies on the	 external  "apropos"  utility,
	      which  can  be  customized by altering value of the 'aproposprg'
	      option.

						:autocmd

       :au[tocmd] {event} {pat} {cmd}
	      register autocommand for the {event}, which can be:
		- DirEnter - performed on entering a directory
	      Event name is case insensitive.

	      {pat} is a comma-separated  list	of  modified  globs  patterns,
	      which can contain tilde or environment variables.	 All paths use
	      slash ('/') as directory separator.  The pattern can start  with
	      a	 '!',  which negates it.  Patterns that do not contain slashes
	      are matched against the last item of the path only  (e.g.	 "dir"
	      in  "/path/dir").	  Literal comma can be entered by doubling it.
	      Two modifications to globs matching are as follows:
		- *  - never matches a slash (i.e., can signify single	direc-
	      tory level)
		-  **  -  matches any character (i.e., can match path of arbi-
	      trary depth)

	      {cmd} is a :command or several of them separated with '|'.

	      Examples of patterns:
		- conf.d      - matches conf.d directory anywhere
		- *.d	      - matches directories ending with ".d" anywhere
		- **.git      - matches something.git, but not .git anywhere
		- **/.git/**  - matches /path/.git/objects, but not /path/.git
		- **/.git/**/ - matches /path/.git/ only (because of  trailing
	      slash)
		-  /etc/*	-  matches  /etc/conf.d/,  /etc/X11,  but  not
	      /etc/X11/fs
		- /etc/**/*.d - matches /etc/conf.d, /etc/X11/conf.d, etc.
		- /etc/**/*   - matches /etc/ itself and any file below it
		- /etc/**/**  - matches /etc/ itself and any file below it

       :au[tocmd] [{event}] [{pat}]
	      list those autocommands that match given event-pattern  combina-
	      tion.
	      {event}  and  {pat} can be omitted to list all autocommands.  To
	      list any autocommands for specific pattern one can use *	place-
	      holder in place of {event}.

       :au[tocmd]! [{event}] [{pat}]
	      remove  autocommands that match given event-pattern combination.
	      Syntax is the same as for listing above.

       :apropos
	      repeat last :apropos command.

						:bmark

       :bmark tag1 [tag2 [tag3...]]
	      bookmark current directory with specified tags.

       :bmark! path tag1 [tag2 [tag3...]]
	      same as :bmark, but allows bookmarking specific path instead  of
	      current  directory.  This is for use in vifmrc and for bookmark-
	      ing files.

	      Path can contain macros that expand to single path (%c, %C,  %d,
	      %D) or those that can expand to multiple paths, but contain only
	      one (%f, %F, %rx).  The latter is done for convenience on	 using
	      the  command  interactively.  Complex macros that include spaces
	      (e.g. "%c:gs/ /_") should be escaped.

						:bmarks

       :bmarks
	      display all bookmarks in a menu.

       :bmarks [tag1 [tag2...]]
	      display menu of bookmarks that  include  all  of	the  specified
	      tags.

						:bmgo

       :bmgo [tag1 [tag2...]]
	      when  there  are	more than one match acts exactly like :bmarks,
	      otherwise navigates to single match immediately  (and  fails  if
	      there is no match).

						:cabbrev

       :ca[bbrev]
	      display menu of command-line mode abbreviations.

       :ca[bbrev] lhs-prefix
	      display  command-line  mode  abbreviations  which left-hand side
	      starts with specified prefix.

       :ca[bbrev] lhs rhs
	      register new or overwrites existing  abbreviation	 for  command-
	      line  mode.   rhs	 can  contain spaces and any special sequences
	      accepted in rhs of  mappings  (see  "Mappings"  section  below).
	      Abbreviations are expanded non-recursively.

						:cnoreabbrev

       :cnorea[bbrev]
	      display menu of command-line mode abbreviations.

       :cnorea[bbrev] lhs-prefix
	      display  command-line  mode  abbreviations  which left-hand side
	      starts with specified prefix.

       :cnorea[bbrev] lhs rhs
	      same as :cabbrev, but mappings in rhs are ignored during	expan-
	      sion.

						:cd

       :cd or :cd ~ or :cd $HOME
	      change to home directory.

       :cd -  go to the last visited directory.

       :cd ~/dir
	      change directory to ~/dir.

       :cd /curr/dir /other/dir
	      change  directory of the current pane to /curr/dir and directory
	      of the other pane to /other/dir.	Relative paths are assumed  to
	      be relative to directory of current view.	 Command won't fail if
	      one of directories is invalid.  All forms of the command	accept
	      macros.

       :cd! /dir
	      same as :cd /dir /dir.

						:change

       :c[hange]
	      create a menu window to alter a files properties.

						:chmod

       :[range]chmod
	      display  file  attributes	 (permission on *nix and properties on
	      Windows) change dialog.

       :[range]chmod[!] arg...
	      only for *nix
	      change permissions for files.  See `man 1 chmod` for arg format.
	      "!" means set permissions recursively.

						:chown

       :[range]chown
	      only for *nix
	      same as co key in normal mode.

       :[range]chown [user][:][group]
	      only for *nix
	      change  owner  and/or  group  of files.  Operates on directories
	      recursively.

						:clone

       :[range]clone[!?]
	      clones files in current directory.  With "?" vifm will  open  vi
	      to edit file names.  "!" forces overwrite.  Macros are expanded.

       :[range]clone[!] path
	      clones  files  to directory specified with the path (absolute or
	      relative to current directory).  "!" forces  overwrite.	Macros
	      are expanded.

       :[range]clone[!] name1 name2...
	      clones  files in current directory giving each next clone a cor-
	      responding name from the argument list.  "!"  forces  overwrite.
	      Macros are expanded.

						:colorscheme

       :colo[rscheme]?
	      print current color scheme name on the status bar.

       :colo[rscheme]
	      display  a menu with a list of available color schemes.  You can
	      choose primary color scheme here.	 It is used  for  view	if  no
	      directory	 specific  colorscheme	fits  current path.  It's also
	      used to set border color (except	view  titles)  and  colors  in
	      menus and dialogs.

       :colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name
	      change  primary  color  scheme to color_scheme_name.  In case of
	      errors (e.g. some colors are not supported by  terminal)	either
	      nothing is changed or color scheme is reset to builtin colors to
	      ensure that TUI is left in a usable state.

       :colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name directory
	      associate directory with the color scheme.  The directory	 argu-
	      ment  can	 be either absolute or relative path when :colorscheme
	      command is executed from command line, but mandatory  should  be
	      an  absolute path when the command is executed in scripts loaded
	      at startup (until vifm is completely loaded).

						:comclear

       :comc[lear]
	      remove all user defined commands.

						:command

       :com[mand]
	      display a menu of user commands.

       :com[mand] beginning
	      display user defined commands that start with the beginning.

       :com[mand] name action
	      set a new user command.
	      Trying to use a reserved command name will result	 in  an	 error
	      message.
	      Use :com[mand]! to overwrite a previously set command.
	      Unlike  vim  user	 commands  do not have to start with a capital
	      letter.  User commands are run in a shell by default.  To run  a
	      command  in  the background you must set it as a background com-
	      mand with & at the end of the commands action (:com rm rm %f &).
	      Command  name  cannot contain numbers or special symbols (except
	      '?' and '!').

       :com[mand] name /pattern
	      set search pattern.

       :com[mand] name =pattern
	      set local filter value.

       :com[mand] name filter{:filter args}
	      set file name filter (see	 :filter  command  description).   For
	      example:

		" display only audio files
		:command onlyaudio filter/.+.\(mp3|wav|mp3|flac|ogg|m4a|wma|ape\)$/i
		" display everything except audio files
		:command noaudio filter!/.+.\(mp3|wav|mp3|flac|ogg|m4a|wma|ape\)$/i

       :com[mand] cmd :commands
	      set  kind	 of  an	 alias for internal command (like in a shell).
	      Passes range given to alias to an aliased	 command,  so  running
	      :%cp after
		:command cp :copy %a
	      equals
		:%copy

						:copy

       :[range]co[py][!?][ &]
	      copy  files  to  directory  of other view.  With "?" prompts for
	      destination file names in an editor.  "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]co[py][!] path[ &]
	      copy files to directory specified with  the  path	 (absolute  or
	      relative to directory of other view).  "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]co[py][!] name1 name2...[ &]
	      copy  files  to  directory of other view giving each next file a
	      corresponding name from the argument  list.   "!"	 forces	 over-
	      write.

						:cquit

       :cq[uit][!]
	      same   as	  :quit,   but	also  aborts  directory	 choosing  via
	      --choose-dir (empties output file)  and  returns	non-zero  exit
	      code.

						:cunabbrev

       :cuna[bbrev] lhs
	      unregister command-line mode abbreviation by its lhs.

       :cuna[bbrev] rhs
	      unregister  command-line	mode  abbreviation by its rhs, so that
	      abbreviation could be removed even after expansion.

						:delbmarks

       :delbmarks
	      remove bookmarks from current directory.

       :delbmarks tag1 [tag2 [tag3...]]
	      remove set of bookmarks that include all of the specified tags.

       :delbmarks!
	      remove all bookmarks.

       :delbmarks! path1 [path2 [path3...]]
	      remove bookmarks of listed paths.

						:delcommand

       :delc[ommand] user_command
	      remove user defined command named user_command.

						:delete

       :[range]d[elete][!][ &]
	      delete selected file  or	files.	 "!"  means  complete  removal
	      (omitting trash).

       :[range]d[elete][!] [reg] [count][ &]
	      delete selected or [count] files to the reg register.  "!" means
	      complete removal (omitting trash).

						:delmarks

       :delm[arks]!
	      delete all marks.

       :delm[arks] marks ...
	      delete specified marks, each argument is treated	as  a  set  of
	      marks.

						:display

	      display menu with registers content.

       :di[splay] list ...
	      display  the  contents  of the numbered and named registers that
	      are mentioned in list (for example "az to display "", "a and  "z
	      content).

						:dirs

       :dirs  display directory stack.

						:echo

       :ec[ho] [<expr>...]
	      evaluate	each  argument	as an expression and output them sepa-
	      rated with a space.  See help on :let command for	 a  definition
	      of <expr>.

						:edit

       :[range]e[dit] [file...]
	      open selected or passed file(s) in editor.  Accepts macros.

						:else

       :el[se]
	      execute  commands until next matching :endif if all other condi-
	      tions didn't match.  See also help on :if and :endif commands.

						:elseif

       :elsei[f] {expr1}
	      execute commands until next matching :elseif, :else or :endif if
	      conditions  of  previous :if and :elseif branches were evaluated
	      to zero.	See also help on :if and :endif commands.

						:empty

       :empty permanently remove  files	 from  all  existing  non-empty	 trash
	      directories  (see "Trash directory" section below).  Also remove
	      all operations from undolist that have no sense after :empty and
	      remove  all  records about files located inside directories from
	      all registers.  Removal is performed  as	background  task  with
	      undetermined amount of work and can be checked via :jobs menu.

						:endif

       :en[dif]
	      end conditional block.  See also help on :if and :else commands.

						:execute

       :exe[cute] [<expr>...]
	      evaluate	each  argument as an expression and join results sepa-
	      rated by a space to get a single string which is	then  executed
	      as a command-line command.  See help on :let command for a defi-
	      nition of <expr>.

						:exit

       :exi[t][!]
	      same as :quit.

						:file

       :f[ile][ &]
	      display menu of programs set for the file type  of  the  current
	      file.  " &" forces running associated program in background.

       :f[ile] arg[ &]
	      run associated command that begins with the arg skipping opening
	      menu.  " &" forces running associated program in background.

						:filetype

       :filet[ype] pat1,pat2,... [{descr}]def_prog[ &],[{descr}]prog2[ &],...
	      associate given program list to each of the  patterns.   Associ-
	      ated  program  (command) is used by handlers of l and Enter keys
	      (and also in the :file menu).  If you need to insert comma  into
	      command  just  double it (",,").	Space followed by an ampersand
	      as two last characters of a command means running of the command
	      in  the  background.   Optional description can be given to each
	      command to ease understanding of what command  will  do  in  the
	      :file menu.  Vifm will try the rest of the programs for an asso-
	      ciation when  the	 default  isn't	 found.	  When	program	 entry
	      doesn't  contain	any  of	 vifm  macros, name of current file is
	      appended as if program entry ended with %c macro on *nix and %"c
	      on  Windows.   On	 Windows path to executables containing spaces
	      can (and should be for correct work with such paths)  be	double
	      quoted.	See  "Patterns"	 section below for pattern definition.
	      See also "Automatic FUSE mounts" section below.  Example for zip
	      archives and several actions:

		filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear
		       \ {Mount with fuse-zip}
		       \ FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR,
		       \ {View contents}
		       \ zip -sf %c | less,
		       \ {Extract here}
		       \ tar -xf %c,

       :filet[ype] filename
	      list  (in	 menu  mode)  currently registered patterns that match
	      specified file name.  Same as ":filextype filename".

						:filextype

       :filex[type] pat1,pat2,... [{ description }] def_program,program2,...
	      same as :filetype, but this command is ignored if not running in
	      X.   In X :filextype is equal to :filetype.  See "Patterns" sec-
	      tion below for pattern definition.   See	also  "Automatic  FUSE
	      mounts" section below.

	      For  example,  consider  the following settings (the order might
	      seem strange, but it's for the demonstration purpose):

		filetype *.html,*.htm
			\ {View in lynx}
			\ lynx
		filextype *.html,*.htm
			\ {Open with dwb}
			\ dwb %f %i &,
		filetype *.html,*.htm
			\ {View in links}
			\ links
		filextype *.html,*.htm
			\ {Open with firefox}
			\ firefox %f &,
			\ {Open with uzbl}
			\ uzbl-browser %f %i &,

	      If you're using vifm inside a terminal emulator that is  running
	      in graphical environment (when X is used on *nix; always on Win-
	      dows), vifm attempts to run application in this order:

	      1. lynx
	      2. dwb
	      3. links
	      4. firefox
	      5. uzbl

	      If there is no graphical environment (checked presence of	 $DIS-
	      PLAY  environment	 variable  on *nix; never happens on Windows),
	      the list will look like:

	      1. lynx
	      2. links

	      Just as if all :filextype commands were not there.

	      The purpose of such differentiation is to allow comfortable  use
	      of vifm with same settings in desktop environment/through remote
	      connection (SSH)/in native console.

       :filext[ype] filename
	      list (in menu mode) currently  registered	 patterns  that	 match
	      specified file name.  Same as ":filetype filename".

						:fileviewer

       :filev[iewer] pat1,pat2,... command1,command2,...
	      register	specified  list of commands as viewers for each of the
	      patterns.	 Viewer is a command which output is captured and dis-
	      played  in  the second pane of vifm after running :view command.
	      When the command doesn't contain any of  vifm  macros,  name  of
	      current  file  is	 appended  as  if command ended with %c macro.
	      Comma escaping and missing  commands  processing	rules  as  for
	      :filetype	 apply	to this command.  See "Patterns" section below
	      for pattern definition.

	      Example for zip archives:

		fileviewer *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear zip -sf %c, echo "No zip to preview:"

       :filev[iewer] filename
	      list (in menu mode) currently  registered	 patterns  that	 match
	      specified filename.

						:filter

       :filter[!] regular_expression_pattern

       :filter[!] /regular_expression_pattern/[flags]
	      will  filter  all	 the  files  out of the directory listing that
	      match the regular expression.  Using second variant you can  use
	      the bar ('|') symbol without escaping.  Empty regular expression
	      (specified by //, "" or '') means using of the last search  pat-
	      tern.  Use '!' to control state of filter inversion after updat-
	      ing filter value (also see 'cpoptions' description).  Filter  is
	      matched  case sensitively on *nix and case insensitively on Win-
	      dows.

	      Supported flags:
		- "i" makes filter case insensitive;
		- "I" makes filter case sensitive.

	      Flags might be repeated multiple times,  later  ones  win	 (e.g.
	      "iiiI" is equivalent to "I" and "IiIi" is the same as "i").

	      " filter all files ending in .o from the filelist.
	      :filter /.o$/

	      Note: vifm uses extended regular expressions.

       :filter
	      reset filter (set it to empty string) and show all files.

       :filter!
	      same as :invert.

       :filter?
	      show information on local, name and auto filters.

						:find

       :[range]fin[d] pattern
	      display  results	of  find  command in the menu.	Searches among
	      selected files if any.  Accepts macros.  By default the  command
	      relies  on  the external "find" utility, which can be customized
	      by altering value of the 'findprg' option.

       :[range]fin[d] -opt...
	      same as :find  above,  but  user	defines	 all  find  arguments.
	      Searches among selected files if any.

       :[range]fin[d] path -opt...
	      same  as	:find  above,  but  user  defines  all find arguments.
	      Ignores selection and range.

       :[range]fin[d]
	      repeat last :find command.

						:finish

       :fini[sh]
	      stop sourcing a script. Can only be used in a vifm script	 file.
	      This is a quick way to skip the rest of the file.

						:grep

       :[range]gr[ep][!] pattern
	      will  show  results  of  grep  command  in the menu.  Add "!" to
	      request inversion of search (look for lines that	do  not	 match
	      pattern).	  Searches  among  selected  files if any and no range
	      given.  Ignores binary files by default.	By default the command
	      relies  on  the external "grep" utility, which can be customized
	      by altering value of the 'grepprg' option.

       :[range]gr[ep][!] -opt...
	      same as :grep above, but user defines all grep arguments,	 which
	      are not escaped.	Searches among selected files if any.

       :[range]gr[ep][!]
	      repeats  last :grep command.  "!" of this command inverts "!" in
	      repeated command.

						:help

       :h[elp]
	      show the help file.

       :h[elp] argument
	      is the same as using ':h argument' in vim.  Use vifm-<something>
	      to  get  help  on vifm (tab completion works).  This form of the
	      command doesn't work when 'vimhelp' option is off.

						:highlight

       :hi[ghlight]
	      will show information about all highlight groups in the  current
	      directory.

       :hi[ghlight] clear
	      will reset all highlighting to builtin defaults.

       :hi[ghlight] ( group-name | {pat1,pat2,...} | /regexp/ )
	      will show information on given highlight group or file name pat-
	      tern of color scheme used in the active view.

       :hi[ghlight]  (	group-name  |	{pat1,pat2,...}	  |   /regexp/[iI]   )
       cterm=style | ctermfg=color | ctermbg=color
	      sets  style  (cterm),  foreground	 (ctermfg)  or/and  background
	      (ctermbg) parameters of highlight group or file name pattern for
	      color scheme used in the active view.

       All style values as well as color names are case insensitive.

       Available style values (some of them can be combined):
	- bold
	- underline
	- reverse or inverse
	- standout
	- none

       Available group-name values:
	- Win - color of all windows (views, dialogs, menus) and default color
       for their content (e.g. regular files in views)
	- Border - color of vertical parts of the border
	- TopLineSel - top line color of the current pane
	- TopLine - top line color of the other pane
	- CmdLine - the command line/status bar color
	- ErrorMsg - color of error messages in the status bar
	- StatusLine - color of the line above the status bar
	- JobLine - color of job line that appears above the status line
	- WildMenu - color of the wild menu items
	- CurrLine - line at cursor position in active view
	- OtherLine - line at cursor position in inactive view
	- Selected - color of selected files
	- Directory - color of directories
	- Link - color of symbolic links in the views
	- BrokenLink - color of broken symbolic links
	- Socket - color of sockets
	- Device - color of block and character devices
	- Executable - color of executable files
	- Fifo - color of fifo pipes

       Available colors:
	- -1 or default or none - default or transparent
	- black	  and lightblack
	- red	  and lightred
	- green	  and lightgreen
	- yellow  and lightyellow
	- blue	  and lightblue
	- magenta and lightmagenta
	- cyan	  and lightcyan
	- white	  and lightwhite
	- 0-255 - corresponding colors from 256-color palette

       Light versions of colors are regular colors with	 bold  attribute  set.
       So  order of arguments of :highlight command is important and it's bet-
       ter to put "cterm" in front of others to prevent	 it  from  overwriting
       attributes set by "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" arguments.

       For  convenience of color scheme authors xterm-like names for 256 color
       palette	 is   also   supported.	   The	 mapping   is	 taken	  from
       http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Xterm256_color_names_for_console_Vim	Dupli-
       cated entries were altered by adding an underscore followed by  numeri-
       cal suffix.

       There are two colors (foreground and  background)  and  only  one  bold
       attribute.   Thus  single  bold	attribute  affects  both  colors  when
       "reverse" attribute is used in vifm run inside terminal	emulator.   At
       the  same  time	linux native console can handle boldness of foreground
       and background colors independently, but for consistency with  terminal
       emulators  this is available only implicitly by using light versions of
       colors.	This behaviour might be changed in the future.

       Although vifm supports 256 colors in a sense they are supported	by  UI
       drawing	library,  whether  you	will be able to use all of them highly
       depends on your terminal.  To set up terminal properly, make sure  that
       $TERM  in the environment you run vifm is set to name of 256-color ter-
       minal  (on  *nixes  it  can  also  be  set  via	X   resources),	  e.g.
       xterm-256color.	One can find list of available terminal names by list-
       ing /usr/lib/terminfo/.	Number of colors supported  by	terminal  with
       current settings can be checked via "tput colors" command.

       Here  is	 the hierarchy of highlight groups, which you need to know for
       using transparency:
	 JobLine
	 StatusLine
	   WildMenu
	 Border
	 CmdLine
	   ErrorMsg
	 Win
	   File name specific highlights
	     Directory
	     Link
	     BrokenLink
	     Socket
	     Device
	     Fifo
	     Executable
	       Selected
		 CurrLine
		 OtherLine
	 TopLine
	   TopLineSel

       "none" means default terminal color for highlight groups at  the	 first
       level of the hierarchy and transparency for all others.

       Here file name specific highlights mean those configured via globs ({})
       or regular expressions (//).  At most one of them is applied  per  file
       entry,  namely  the first that matches file name, hence order of :high-
       light commands might be important in certain cases.

						:history

       :his[tory]
	      creates a pop-up menu of directories visited.

       :his[tory] x
	      x can be:
	      d[ir]	or . show directory history.
	      c[md]	or : show command line history.
	      s[earch]	or / show search history and search forward on l key.
	      f[search] or / show search history and search forward on l key.
	      b[search] or ? show search history and search backward on l key.
	      i[nput]	or @ show prompt history (e.g. on one file renaming).
	      fi[lter]	or = show filter history (see description of  the  "="
	      normal mode command).

						:if

       :if {expr1}
	      starts  conditional  block.   Commands  are  executed until next
	      matching :elseif, :else or :endif command if  {expr1}  evaluates
	      to non-zero, otherwise they are ignored.	See also help on :else
	      and :endif commands.

	      Example:

		if $TERM == 'screen.linux'
		    highlight CurrLine ctermfg=lightwhite ctermbg=lightblack
		elseif $TERM == 'tmux'
		    highlight CurrLine cterm=reverse ctermfg=black ctermbg=white
		else
		    highlight CurrLine cterm=bold,reverse ctermfg=black ctermbg=white
		endif

						:invert

       :invert [f]
	      invert file name filter.

       :invert? [f]
	      show current filter state.

       :invert s
	      invert selection.

       :invert o
	      invert sorting order of the primary sorting key.

       :invert? o
	      show sorting order of the primary sorting key.

						:jobs

       :jobs  shows menu of current backgrounded processes.

						:let

       :let $ENV_VAR = <expr>
	      sets environment variable.  Warning: setting  environment	 vari-
	      able to an empty string on Windows removes it.

       :let $ENV_VAR .= <expr>
	      append value to environment variable.

       :let &[l:|g:]opt = <expr>
	      sets option value.

       :let &[l:|g:]opt .= <expr>
	      append value to string option.

       :let &[l:|g:]opt += <expr>
	      increasing option value, adding sub-values.

       :let &[l:|g:]opt -= <expr>
	      decreasing option value, removing sub-values.

       Where  <expr> could be a single-quoted string, double-quoted string, an
       environment variable, function call or a concatanation of any  of  them
       in any order using the '.' operator.  Any whitespace is ignored.

						:locate

       :locate filename
	      use "locate" command to create a menu of filenames.  Selecting a
	      file from the menu will reload the current file list in vifm  to
	      show  the	 selected  file.  By default the command relies on the
	      external "locate" utility (it's assumed  that  its  database  is
	      already built), which can be customized by altering value of the
	      'locateprg' option.

       :locate
	      repeats last :locate command.

						:ls

       :ls    lists windows of active terminal multiplexer (only when terminal
	      multiplexer  is  used).  This is achieved by issuing proper com-
	      mand for active terminal multiplexer, thus the list is not  han-
	      dled by vifm.

						:lstrash

       :lstrash
	      displays	a  menu	 with list of files in trash.  Each element of
	      the list is original path of a deleted file, thus the  list  can
	      contain duplicates.

						:mark

       :[range]ma[rk][?] x [/full/path] [filename]
	      Set  mark	 x (a-zA-Z0-9) at /full/path and filename.  By default
	      current directory is being used.	If no filename was  given  and
	      /full/path  is  current  directory  then last file in [range] is
	      used.  Using of macros is allowed.  Question mark will stop com-
	      mand from overwriting existing marks.

						:marks

       :marks create a pop-up menu of marks.

       :marks list ...
	      display the contents of the marks that are mentioned in list.

						:messages

       :mes[sages]
	      shows previously given messages (up to 50).

						:mkdir

       :mkdir[!] dir ...
	      creates  directories  with  given	 names.	 "!" means make parent
	      directories as needed.  Macros are expanded.

						:move

       :[range]m[ove][!?][ &]
	      move files to directory of other view.   With  "?"  prompts  for
	      destination file names in an editor.  "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]m[ove][!] path[ &]
	      move  files  to  directory  specified with the path (absolute or
	      relative to directory of other view).  "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]m[ove][!] name1 name2...[ &]
	      move files to directory of other view giving each	 next  file  a
	      corresponding  name  from	 the  argument list.  "!" forces over-
	      write.

						:nohlsearch

       :noh[lsearch]
	      clear selection in current pane.

						:normal

       :norm[al][!] commands
	      execute normal mode commands.  If "!" is used, user defined map-
	      pings  are  ignored.   Unfinished	 last command is aborted as if
	      <esc> or <c-c> was typed.	 A ":" should be  completed  as	 well.
	      Commands	can't  start  with  a space, so put a count of 1 (one)
	      before it.

						:only

       :on[ly]
	      switch to a one window view.

						:popd

       :popd  remove pane directories from stack.

						:pushd

       :pushd[!] /curr/dir [/other/dir]
	      add pane directories to stack and	 process  arguments  like  :cd
	      command.

       :pushd exchange the top two items of the directory stack.

						:put

       :pu[t][!] [reg] [ &]
	      puts  files  from specified register (" by default) into current
	      directory.  "!" moves files from their original location instead
	      of  copying them.	 During this operation no confirmation dialogs
	      will be shown, all checks are performed beforehand.

						:pwd

       :pw[d] show the present working directory.

						:quit

       :q[uit][!]
	      exit vifm (add ! to skip saving changes and checking for	active
	      backgrounded commands).

						:redraw

       :redr[aw]
	      redraw the screen immediately.

						:registers

       :reg[isters]
	      display menu with registers content.

       :reg[isters] list ...
	      display  the  contents  of the numbered and named registers that
	      are mentioned in list (for example "az to display "", "a and  "z
	      content).

						:rename

       :[range]rename[!]
	      rename  files  using  vi	to  edit names. ! means go recursively
	      through directories.

       :[range]rename name1 name2...
	      rename each of selected files to a corresponding name.

						:restart

       :restart
	      free  a  lot  of	things	(histories,  commands,	etc.),	reread
	      vifminfo and vifmrc files and run startup commands passed in the
	      argument list, thus losing all unsaved changes (e.g. recent his-
	      tory or keys mapped in current session).

						:restore

       :[range]restore
	      restore  file  from trash directory, doesn't work outside one of
	      trash directories.  See "Trash directory" section below.

						:rlink

       :[range]rlink[!?]
	      create relative symbolic links to files in  directory  of	 other
	      view.  With "?" prompts for destination file names in an editor.
	      "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]rlink[!] path
	      create relative symbolic links of files in  directory  specified
	      with the path (absolute or relative to directory of other view).
	      "!" forces overwrite.

       :[range]rlink[!] name1 name2...
	      create relative symbolic links of files in  directory  of	 other
	      view  giving  each next link a corresponding name from the argu-
	      ment list.  "!" forces overwrite.

						:screen

       :screen
	      toggle whether to use the terminal multiplexer or not.
	      A terminal multiplexer uses pseudo terminals to  allow  multiple
	      windows  to be used in the console or in a single xterm.	Start-
	      ing vifm from  terminal  multiplexer  with  appropriate  support
	      turned  on  will	cause  vifm to open a new terminal multiplexer
	      window for each new file edited or program launched from vifm.
	      This requires screen version 3.9.9 or newer for  the  screen  -X
	      argument or tmux (1.8 version or newer is recommended).

       :screen?
	      display	whether	 integration  with  terminal  multiplexers  is
	      enabled.

       Note: the command is called screen for historical  reasons  (when  tmux
       wasn't  yet  supported) and might be changed in future releases, or get
       an alias.

						:set

       :se[t] display all options that differ from their default value.

       :se[t] all
	      display all options.

       :se[t] opt1=val1 opt2='val2' opt3="val3" ...
	      sets given options.  For local options both values are set.
	      You can use following syntax:
	       - for all options - option, option? and option&
	       - for boolean options - nooption, invoption and option!
	       - for integer options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
	       - for string options - option=x and option+=x
	       - for string list options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
	       - for enumeration options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
	       - for set options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
	       - for charset options  -	 option=x,  option+=x,	option-=x  and
	      option^=x

	      the meaning:
	       - option - turn option on (for boolean) or print its value (for
	      all others)
	       - nooption - turn option off
	       - invoption - invert option state
	       - option! - invert option state
	       - option? - print option value
	       - option& - reset option to its default value
	       - option=x or option:x - set option to x
	       - option+=x - add/append x to option
	       - option-=x - remove (or subtract) x from option
	       - option^=x - toggle x presence among values of the option

	      Option name can be prepended  and	 appended  by  any  number  of
	      whitespace characters.

						:setglobal

       :setg[lobal]
	      display all global options that differ from their default value.

       :setg[lobal] all
	      display all global options.

       :setg[lobal] opt1=val1 opt2='val2' opt3="val3" ...
	      same  as	:set, but changes/prints only global options or global
	      values of local options.	Changes to the	latter	might  be  not
	      visible until directory is changed.

       :setl[ocal]
	      display all local options that differ from their default value.

       :setl[ocal] all
	      display all local options.

       :setl[ocal] opt1=val1 opt2='val2' opt3="val3" ...
	      same  as	:set,  but  changes/prints  only local values of local
	      options.

						:shell

       :sh[ell][!]
	      start a shell in current	directory.   "!"  suppresses  spawning
	      dedicated	 window	 of terminal multiplexer for a shell.  To make
	      vifm adaptive to environment it uses  $SHELL  if	it's  defined,
	      otherwise 'shell' value is used.

						:sort

       :sor[t]
	      display  dialog  with  different	sorting	 methods, when one can
	      select primary sorting key.  When 'viewcolumns' options is empty
	      and  'lsview'  is	 off,  changing	 primary sorting key will also
	      affect view look (in particular the second column	 of  the  view
	      will be changed).

       :so[urce] file
	      read command-line commands from the file.

						:split

       :sp[lit]
	      switch to a two window horizontal view.

       :sp[lit]!
	      toggle horizontal window splitting.

       :sp[lit] path
	      splits  the  window  horizontally to show both file directories.
	      Also changes other pane to path (absolute or relative to current
	      directory of active pane).

						:substitute

       :[range]s[ubstitute]/pattern/string/[flags]
	      for each file in range replace a match of pattern with string.

       String  can  contain \0...\9 to link to capture groups (\0 - all match,
       \1 - first group, etc.).

       Pattern is stored in search history.

       Available flags:

	 - i - ignore case (the 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options  are  not
	   used)

	 - I - don't ignore case (the 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase' options are
	   not used)

	 - g - substitute all matches in each file name (each g toggles this)

       :[range]s[ubstitute]/pattern
	      substitute pattern with an empty string.

       :[range]s[ubstitute]//string/[flags]
	      use last pattern from search history.

       :[range]s[ubstitute]
	      repeat previous substitution command.

						:sync

       :sync [relative path]
	      change the other pane to the current pane directory or  to  some
	      path  relative  to  the  current	directory.   Using  macros  is

	      nize cursor position.


       :sync! [location | cursorpos | localopts | filters | all]...
	      change  enumerated  properties of the other pane to match corre-
	      sponding properties of the current  pane.	  Arguments  have  the
	      following meanings:

		- location - current directory of the pane;

		- cursorpos  -	cursor	position  (doesn't  make sense without
		  "location");

		- localopts - all local options;

		- filters - all filters;

		- all - all of the above.

						:touch

       :touch file...
	      create file(s).  Aborts  on  errors.   Doesn't  update  time  of
	      existing files.  Macros are expanded.

						:tr

       :[range]tr/pattern/string/
	      for each file in range transliterate the characters which appear
	      in pattern to  the  corresponding	 character  in	string.	  When
	      string  is shorter than pattern, it's padded with its last char-
	      acter.

						:trashes

       :trashes
	      lists all valid trash directories in a menu.  Only non-empty and
	      writable	trash directories are shown.  This is exactly the list
	      of directories that are cleared when :empty command is executed.

	      directory of active pane).

						:wincmd

       :[count]winc[md] {arg}
	      same as running Ctrl-W [count] {arg}.

		- . - current pane
		- , - other pane

						:write

       :w[rite]

Ranges
       The ranges implemented include:
	 2,3 - from second to third file in the list (including it)
	 % - the entire directory.
	 . - the current position in the filelist.
	 $ - the end of the filelist.
	 't - the mark position t.

       Examples:

	 :%delete

       would delete all files in the directory.

	 :2,4delete

       would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.

	 :.,$delete

       would  delete  the  files  from	the current position to the end of the
       filelist.

	 :3delete4

       would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

       If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
       user can chose what to do next.

       The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

Command macros
       The command macros may be used in user commands.

       %a     User  arguments.	 When  user arguments contain macros, they are
	      expanded before preforming substitution of %a.

       %c %"c The current file under the cursor.

       %C %"C The current file under the cursor in the other directory.

       %f %"f All of the selected files.

       %F %"F All of the selected files in the other directory list.

       %b %"b Same as %f %F.

       %d %"d Full path to current directory.

       %D %"D Full path to other file list directory.

       %rx %"rx
	      Full paths to files in the register {x}.	 In  case  of  invalid
	      symbol in place of {x}, it's processed with the rest of the line
	      and default register is used.

       %m     Show command output in a menu.

       %M     Same as %m, but l (or Enter) key is handled like for :locate and
	      :find commands.

       %u     Process  command output as list of paths and compose custom view
	      out of it.

       %U     Same as %u, but implies less list updates inside vifm, which  is
	      absence of sorting at the moment.

       %S     Show command output in the status bar.

       %s     Execute  command	in split window of active terminal multiplexer
	      (ignored if not running inside one).

       %n     Forbid using of terminal multiplexer to run the command.

       %i     Completely ignore command output.


       %pc    Marks end of the main command and beginning of  the  clear  com-
	      mand, which is invoked on closing preview of a file.

       The following dimensions and coordinates are in characters:

       %px    x coordinate of top-left corner of preview area.

       %py    y coordinate of top-left corner of preview area.

       %pw    width of preview area.

       %ph    height of preview area.


       Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

       Note  that %m, %M, %s, %S, %i, %u and %U macros are mutually exclusive.
       Only the last one of them on the command will take effect.

       You can use file name modifiers after %c, %C, %f, %F,  %b,  %d  and  %D
       macros.	Supported modifiers are:

	 - :p		- full path

	 - :u		  -   UNC   name   of	path   (e.g.   "\\server"   in
	   "\\server\share"), Windows only.  Expands to current computer  name
	   for not UNC paths.

	 - :~		- relative to the home directory

	 - :.		- relative to current directory

	 - :h		- head of the file name

	 - :t		- tail of the file name

	 - :r		- root of the file name (without last extension)

	 - :e		- extension of the file name (last one)

	 - :s?pat?sub?	 -  substitute	the  first occurrence of pat with sub.
	   You can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat  or
	   sub.

	 - :gs?pat?sub? - like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with
	   sub.

       See ':h filename-modifiers' in Vim's  documentation  for	 the  detailed
       description.

       Using  %x means expand corresponding macro escaping all characters that
       have special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes and	escape
       only  backslash	and  double  quote characters, which is more useful on
       Windows systems.

       Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s  macros  in
       the command is unimportant.  All their occurrences are removed from the
       resulting command.

       %c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C  and  %F  are
       expanded to full paths.	%f and %F follow this in %b too.

       :com move mv %f %D
	      set  the	:move command to move all of the files selected in the
	      current directory to the other directory.

       The %a macro is replaced with any arguments given to an alias  command.
       All arguments are considered optional.
	      :com  lsl !!ls -l %a - set the lsl command to execute ls -l with
	      or without an argument.

       :lsl<Enter>
	      will list the directory contents of the current directory.

       :lsl filename<Enter>
	      will list only the given filename.

       The macros can also be used in directly executing commands.   ":!mv  %f
       %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other direc-
       tory.

       Appending & to the end of a command causes it to	 be  executed  in  the
       background.   Typically	you want to run two kinds of external commands
       in the background:

	 - GUI applications that doesn't fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);

	 - console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).

       You don't want to run terminal commands, which require  terminal	 input
       or output something in background because they will mess up vifm's TUI.
       Anyway, if you did run such a command, you can use Ctrl-L key to update
       vifm's TUI.

       Rewriting  the example command with macros given above with background-
       ing:

       %m, %M, %s, %S, %u and %U macros cannot	be  combined  with  background
       mark (" &") as it doesn't make much sense.

Command backgrounding
       Copy  and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why
       vifm supports backgrounding of this  two	 operations.   To  run	:copy,
       :move  or :delete command in the background just add " &" at the end of
       a command.

       For each background operation a new thread is created.	Currently  job
       cannot be stopped or paused.

       You  can	 see  if  command  is  still running in the :jobs menu.	 Back-
       grounded commands have progress instead	of  process  id	 at  the  line
       beginning.

       Background operations cannot be undone.

Cancellation
       Note that cancellation works somewhat different on Windows platform due
       to different mechanism of break signal  propagation.   One  also	 might
       need to use Ctrl-Break shortcut instead of Ctrl-C.

       There are two types of operations that can be cancelled:

	 - file system operations;

	 - mounting  with  FUSE	 (but  not  unmounting as it can cause loss of
	   data);

	 - calls of external applications.

       Note that vifm never terminates applications, it	 sends	SIGINT	signal
       and lets the application quit normally.

       When one of set of operations is cancelled (e.g. copying of 5th file of
       10 files), further operations are cancelled too.	  In  this  case  undo
       history will contain only actually performed operations.

       Cancelled  operations are indicated by "(cancelled)" suffix appended to
       information message on statusbar.

       File system operations

       Currently the following commands	 can  be  cancelled:  :alink,  :chmod,
       :chown,	:clone,	 :copy,	 :delete,  :mkdir,  :move,  :restore,  :rlink,
       :touch.	File putting (on p/P key) can be cancelled as well.  It's  not
       hard to see that these are mainly long-running operations.

       Cancelling  commands when they are repeated for undo/redo operations is
       allowed for convenience, but is not recommended	as  further  undo/redo
       operations  might  get  blocked	by side-effects of partially cancelled
       group of operations.

       These commands can't be cancelled: :empty, :rename, :substitute, :tr.

       Mounting with FUSE

       It's not considered to be an error, so only notification on the	status
       bar is shown.

       External application calls

       Each  of	 this  operations  can	be  cancelled: :apropos, :find, :grep,
       :locate.

Patterns
       :highlight, :filetype, :filextype and :fileviewer commands support both
       globs  and  regular expressions as patterns to match file names or full
       paths.

       There are five possible ways to write them:

	 1. {comma-seperated-name-globs}

	 2. {{comma-seperated-path-globs}}

	 3. /name-regular-expression/[iI]

	 4. //path-regular-expression//[iI]

	 5. undecorated-pattern

       The last form is implicitly refers to one of others.   :highlight  does
       not  accept  undecorated	 form,	while :filetype, :filextype and :file-
       viewer treat it as list of name globals.

       Regular expression patterns are case insensitive by default.

       "Globs" section below provides short overview of globs and some	impor-
       tant points that one needs to know about them.

Globs
       Globs are always case insensitive as it makes sense in general case.

       *, ?, [ and ] are treated as special symbols in the pattern.  E.g.

	 :filetype * less %c

       matches all files.  One can use character classes for escaping, so

	 :filetype [*] less %c

       matches	only  one file name, the one which contains only asterisk sym-
       bol.

       * means any number of any characters  (possibly	an  empty  substring),
       with one exception: asterisk at the pattern beginning doesn't match dot
       in the first position.  E.g.

	 :fileviewer *.zip,*.jar zip -sf %c

       associates using of zip program to preview all files with  zip  or  jar
       extensions as listing of their content.

       ? means any character at this position.	E.g.

	 :fileviewer ?.out file %c

       calls  file  tool  for all files which has exactly one character before
       their extension (e.g. a.out, b.out).

       Square brackets designate character class, which means that whole char-
       acter  class matches against any of characters listed in it.  For exam-
       ple

	 :fileviewer *.[ch] highlight -O xterm256 -s dante --syntax c %c

       makes vifm call highlight program to colorize source and	 header	 files
       in C language for a 256-color terminal.	Equal command would be

	 :fileviewer *.c,*.h highlight -O xterm256 -s dante --syntax c %c


       Inside  square brackets ^ or ! can be used for symbol class negotiation
       and the - symbol to set a range. ^ and ! should appear right after  the
       opening square bracket.	For example

	 :filetype *.[!d]/ inspect_dir

       associates  inspect_dir	as additional handler for all directories that
       have one character extension unless it's "d" letter.  And

	 :filetype [0-9].jpg sxiv

       associates sxiv picture viewer only for JPEG-files that contain	single
       digit in their name.

:set options
       Local options
	      These are kind of options that are local to a specific view.  So
	      you can set ascending sorting order for left pane and descending
	      order for right pane.

	      In  addition  to being local to views, each such option also has
	      two values:

		- local to current directory (value  associated	 with  current
		  location);

		- global  to  current  directory  (value  associated  with the
		  pane).

	      The idea is that current	directory  can	be  made  a  temporary
	      exception	 to regular configuration of the view, until directory
	      change.  Use :setlocal for that.	:setglobal changes view	 value
	      not  affecting  settings	until  directory change.  :set applies
	      changes immediately to all values.


       'aproposprg'
	      type: string
	      default: "apropos %a"
	      Specifies format for an external command to be  invoked  by  the
	      :apropos command.	 The format supports expanding of macros, spe-
	      cific for a particular *prg option, and %% sequence for  insert-
	      ing  percent  sign literally.  This option should include the %a
	      macro to specify placement of arguments passed to	 the  :apropos
	      command.	 If the macro is not used, it will be implicitly added
	      after a space to the value of this option.

       'autochpos'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      When disabled vifm will set cursor to the first line in the view
	      after  :cd and :pushd commands instead of saved cursor position.
	      Disabling this will also make vifm clear information about  cur-
	      sor position in the view history on :cd and :pushd commands (and
	      on startup if 'autochpos' is disabled in the vifmrc).  l key  in
	      the  ":history  ." and ":trashes" menus is treated like :cd com-
	      mand.  This option also affects marks so that  navigating	 to  a
	      mark doesn't restore cursor position.

       'columns' 'co'
	      type: integer
	      default: terminal width on startup
	      Terminal width in characters.

       'cdpath' 'cd'
	      type: string list
	      default: value of $CDPATH with commas instead of colons
	      Specifies locations to check on changing directory with relative
	      path that doesn't start with "./"	 or  "../".   When  non-empty,
	      current  directory  is  examined after directories listed in the
	      option.

	      This option doesn't affect completion of :cd command.

	      Example:

		set cdpath=~

	      This way ":cd bin" will switch  to  "~/bin"  even	 if  directory
	      named  "bin" exists in current directory, while ":cd ./bin" com-
	      mand will ignore value of 'cdpath'.

       'chaselinks'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      When enabled path of view is always resolved to real path	 (with
	      all symbolic links expanded).

       'classify'
	      type: string list
	      default: ":dir:/"
	      Specifies	 file  name  prefixes  and  suffixes depending on file
	      types.  The format is: [{prefix}]:{filetype}:[{suffix}].	Either
	      {prefix}	or  {suffix}  or both of them can be omitted (which is
	      the default for all unspecified file types),  this  means	 empty
	      {prefix}	and/or {suffix}.  {prefix} and {suffix} should consist
	      exactly of one character.	 Elements  are	separated  by  commas.
	      Neither  prefixes	 nor  suffixes are part of file names, so they
	      don't affect commands which operate on file names	 in  any  way.
	      Comma  (',')  character  should  not be used.  List of file type
	      names can be found in the description of filetype() function.

       'confirm' 'cf'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Ask about permanent deletion of files (on D or :delete!  command
	      or on undo/redo operation).

       'cpoptions' 'cpo'
	      type: charset
	      default: "fst"
	      Contains	a  sequence  of	 single-character  flags.   Each  flag
	      enables behaviour of older versions of vifm.  Flags:
	      f - when	included,  running  :filter  command  results  in  not
	      inverted	(matching  files  are  filtered	 out)  and :filter! in
	      inverted (matching files are left) filter, when omitted, meaning
	      of the exclamation mark changes to the opposite;
	      s	 -  when  included,  yy, dd and DD normal mode commands act on
	      selection, otherwise they operate on current file only;
	      t - when included, <tab> (thus  <c-i>)  behave  as  <space>  and
	      switch  active pane, otherwise <tab> and <c-i> go forward in the
	      view history.

       'deleteprg'
	      type: string
	      default: ""
	      Specifies program to run on files that are permanently  removed.
	      When  empty,  files are removed as usual, otherwise this command
	      is invoked on each file by appending its name.  If  the  command
	      doesn't remove files, they will remain on the file system.

       'dirsize'
	      type: enum
	      default: size
	      Controls	how  size  of  directories is displayed in file views.
	      The following values are possible:
	       - size	- size of directory (i.e., size used to store list  of
	      files)
	       -  nitems - number of entries in the directory (excluding . and
	      ..)

	      Size obtained via ga/gA overwrites this setting so seeing	 count
	      of files and occasionally size of directories is possible.

       'dotdirs'
	      type: set
	      default: nonrootparent
	      Controls	displaying  of	dot directories.  The following values
	      are possible:
	       - rootparent    - show "../" in root directory of file system
	       - nonrootparent - show "../" in non-root	 directories  of  file
	      system

	      Note  that  empty directories always contain "../" entry regard-
	      less of value of this option.  "../" disappears at the moment at
	      least one file is created.

       'fastrun'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      With  this  option  turned on you can run partially entered com-
	      mands with unambiguous beginning using :! (e.g. :!Te instead  of
	      :!Terminal or :!Te<tab>).

       'fillchars' 'fcs'
	      type: string list
	      default: ""
	      Sets characters used to fill borders.
		item	   default  Used for
		vborder:c  ' '	    left, middle and right vertical borders

	      If value is omitted, its default value is used.  Example:

		set fillchars=vborder:.

       'findprg'
	      type: string
	      default:	"find %s %a -print , -type d \( ! -readable -o ! -exe-
	      cutable \) -prune"
	      Specifies format for an external command to be  invoked  by  the
	      :find  command.	The  format supports expanding of macros, spe-
	      cific for a particular *prg option, and %% sequence for  insert-
	      ing  percent  sign literally.  This option should include the %s
	      macro to specify placement of list of paths to search in and  %a
	      or  %A  macro  to	 specify  placement of arguments passed to the
	      :find command.  If some of the macros are not used, they will be
	      implicitly added after a space to the value of the option in the
	      following order: %s, %a.	Note that when neither %a nor  %A  are
	      specified, it's %a which is added implicitly.

	      The  macros can slightly change their meaning depending on :find
	      command arguments.  When the first argument points to an	exist-
	      ing  directory,  %s is assigned all arguments and %a/%A are left
	      empty.  Otherwise, %s is assigned a dot  (".")  meaning  current
	      directory	 or  list  of  selected file names, if any.  %a/%A are
	      assigned arguments when first argument starts with a dash ("-"),
	      otherwise	 %a gets an escaped version of arguments, prepended by
	      "-name" (on *nix) or "-iname" (on Windows) predicate.

	      %a and %A macros contain almost the same value,  the  difference
	      is  that %a can be escaped and %A is never escaped.  %A is to be
	      used mainly on Windows, where shell escaping is a mess  and  can
	      break command execution.

	      Optional	%u  or %U macro could be used (if both specified %U is
	      chosen) to force redirection to custom or unsorted  custom  view
	      respectively.

	      Starting	from Windows Server 2003 a where command is available,
	      one can configure vifm to use it in the following way:

		set findprg="where /R %s %A"

	      As the syntax of this command is rather limited, one  can't  use
	      :find command with selection of more than one item in this case.
	      The command looks for files only	completely  ignoring  directo-
	      ries.

	      When  using  find	 port  on  Windows, another option is to setup
	      'findprg' like this:

		set findprg="find %s %a"

       'followlinks'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Follow links on l or Enter.

       'fusehome'
	      type: string
	      default: "($XDG_DATA_HOME/.local/share | $VIFM)/fuse/"
	      Directory to be used as a root dir for FUSE  mounts.   Value  of
	      the   option   can   contain   environment  variables  (in  form
	      "$envname"), which will be expanded (prepend it with a slash  to
	      prevent  expansion).   The  value	 should	 expand to an absolute
	      path.

	      If you change this option,  vifm	won't  remount	anything.   It
	      affects future mounts only.  See "Automatic FUSE mounts" section
	      below for more information.

       'gdefault' 'gd'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      When on, 'g' flag is on for :substitute by default.

       'grepprg'
	      type: string
	      default: "grep -n -H -I -r %i %a %s"
	      Specifies format for an external command to be  invoked  by  the
	      :grep  command.	The  format supports expanding of macros, spe-
	      cific for a particular *prg option, and %% sequence for  insert-
	      ing  percent  sign literally.  This option should include the %i
	      macro to specify placement of  "-v"  string  when	 inversion  of
	      results  is  requested,  %a  or %A macro to specify placement of
	      arguments passed to the :grep command and the %s macro to	 spec-
	      ify  placement  of  list	of files to search in.	If some of the
	      macros are not used, they will be implicitly added after a space
	      to the value of the 'grepprg' option in the following order: %i,
	      %a, %s.  Note that when neither %a nor %A are specified, it's %a
	      which is added implicitly.

	      Optional	%u  or %U macro could be used (if both specified %U is
	      chosen) to force redirection to custom or unsorted  custom  view
	      respectively.

	      See  'findprg'  option  for description of difference between %a
	      and %A.

	      Example of setup to use ack (http://beyondgrep.com/) instead  of
	      grep:

		set grepprg=ack\ -H\ -r\ %i\ %a\ %s

	      or   The	 Silver	 Searcher  (https://github.com/ggreer/the_sil-
	      ver_searcher):

		set grepprg=ag\ --line-numbers\ %i\ %a\ %s



       'history' 'hi'
	      type: integer
	      default: 15
	      Maximum number of directories in the view history and  lines  in
	      the prompt, command line and search histories.

       'hlsearch' 'hls'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Highlight all matches of search pattern.

       'iec'  type: boolean
	      default: false
	      Use KiB, MiB, ... instead of KB, MB, ...

       'ignorecase' 'ic'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      Ignore  case  in search patterns (:substitute, / and ? commands)
	      and characters after f and F commands.  It doesn't  affect  file
	      filtering.

       'incsearch' 'is'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      When this option is set, search and view update for local filter
	      is be performed starting from initial cursor position each  time
	      search pattern is changed.

       'iooptions'
	      type: set
	      default:
	      Controls	details	 of file operations.  The following values are
	      available:
	       - fastfilecloning - perform fast file cloning  (copy-on-write),
	      when available
				   (available on Linux and btrfs file system).

       'laststatus' 'ls'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Controls if status bar is visible.

       'lines'
	      type: integer
	      default: terminal height on startup
	      Terminal height in lines.

       'locateprg'
	      type: string
	      default: "locate %a"
	      Specifies	 format	 for  an external command to be invoked by the
	      :locate command.	The format supports expanding of macros,  spe-
	      cific  for a particular *prg option, and %% sequence for insert-
	      ing percent sign literally.  This option should include  the  %a
	      macro  to	 specify  placement of arguments passed to the :locate
	      command.	If the macro is not used, it will be implicitly	 added
	      after a space to the value of this option.

	      Optional	%u  or %U macro could be used (if both specified %U is
	      chosen) to force redirection to custom or unsorted  custom  view
	      respectively.

       'mintimeoutlen'
	      type: integer
	      default: 150
	      The  fracture  of	 'timeoutlen'  in  milliseconds that is waited
	      between subsequent input polls, which affects various  asynchro-
	      nous  operations	(detecting  changes  made by external applica-
	      tions, monitoring background jobs, redrawing UI).	 There are  no
	      strict guarantees, however the higher this value is, the less is
	      CPU load in idle mode.

       'lsview'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      scope: local
	      When this option is set, directory view  will  be	 displayed  in
	      multiple	columns	 with  file names similar to output of `ls -x`
	      command.	See "ls-like view" section below for  format  descrip-
	      tion.

       'number' 'nu'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      scope: local
	      Print  line  number  in  front  of  each file name when 'lsview'
	      option is turned off.  Use 'numberwidth'	to  control  width  of
	      line number.  Also see 'relativenumber'.

       'numberwidth' 'nuw'
	      type: integer
	      default: 4
	      scope: local
	      Minimal number of characters for line number field.

       'relativenumber' 'rnu'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      scope: local
	      Print  relative  line  number  in	 front	of each file name when
	      'lsview' option is turned off.   Use  'numberwidth'  to  control
	      width  of	 line  number.	 Various  combinations of 'number' and
	      'relativenumber' lead to such results:

				      nonumber		     number

		  norelativenumber   | first		    |	1 first
				     | second		    |	2 second
				     | third		    |	3 third

		    relativenumber   |	 1 first	    |	1 first
				     |	 0 second	    |2	  second
				     |	 1 third	    |	1 third


       'rulerformat' 'ruf'
	      type: string
	      default: "%l/%S "
	      Determines the content of the ruler.  Its minimal	 width	is  13
	      characters  and  it's  right aligned.  Following macros are sup-
	      ported:
	       %= - separation point between left and right aligned halves  of
	      the line
	       %l - file number
	       %L  -  total  number  of	 files in view (including filtered out
	      ones)
	       %- - number of filtered out files
	       %S - number of displayed files
	       %= - separation point between left and right align items
	       %% - percent sign
	       %[ - designates beginning of an optional block
	       %] - designates end of an optional block

	      Percent sign can be followed by optional	minimum	 field	width.
	      Add '-' before minimum field width if you want field to be right
	      aligned.	Note ambiguity with  number  of	 filtered  out	files,
	      which can be resolved with the help of width field ("%0-").

	      Example:

		set rulerformat='%2l-%S%[ +%0-%]'

       'runexec'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      Run executable file on Enter or l.

       'scrollbind' 'scb'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      When  this  option  is  set, vifm will try to keep difference of
	      scrolling positions of two windows constant.

       'scrolloff' 'so'
	      type: integer
	      default: 0
	      Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the  cur-
	      sor.   If you want cursor line to always be in the middle of the
	      view (except at the beginning or end of the file list), set this
	      option to some large value (e.g. 999).

       'shell' 'sh'
	      type: string
	      default: $SHELL or "/bin/sh" or "cmd" (on MS-Windows)
	      Full path to the shell to use to run external commands.  On *nix
	      a shell argument can be supplied.

       'shortmess' 'shm'
	      type: charset
	      default: "p"
	      Contains	a  sequence  of	 single-character  flags.   Each  flag
	      enables shortening of some message displayed by vifm in the TUI.
	      Flags:
	      T - truncate status-bar messages in the middle if they  are  too
	      long  to fit on the command line.	 "..." will appear in the mid-
	      dle.
	      p - use tilde shortening in view titles.

       'slowfs'
	      type: string list
	      default: ""
	      only for *nix
	      A list of mounter fs name beginnings (first column in  /etc/mtab
	      or  /proc/mounts) or paths prefixes for fs/directories that work
	      too slow for you.	 This option can be used  to  stop  vifm  from
	      making  some  requests  to particular kinds of file systems that
	      can slow down file browsing.  Currently this means  don't	 check
	      if directory has changed, skip check if target of symbolic links
	      exists, assume that link target located  on  slow	 fs  to	 be  a
	      directory	 (allows  entering directories and navigating to files
	      via gf).	If you set the option to "*", it means all the systems
	      are  considered  slow  (usefull for cygwin, where all the checks
	      might render vifm very slow if there are network mounts).

	      Example for autofs root /mnt/autofs:

		set slowfs+=/mnt/autofs

       'smartcase' 'scs'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      Overrides the ignorecase option if the search  pattern  contains
	      at  least	 one  upper case character.  Only used when ignorecase
	      option is enabled.  It doesn't affect file filtering.

       'sort' type: string list
	      default: +name on *nix and +iname on Windows
	      scope: local
	      Sets list of sorting keys (first item is primary key, second  is
	      secondary key, etc.):
		 [+-]ext     - extension of files and directories
		 [+-]fileext - extension of files only
		 [+-]name    - name (including extension)
		 [+-]iname   - name (including extension, ignores case)
		 [+-]type		  -		 file		  type
	      (dir/reg/exe/link/char/block/sock/fifo)
		 [+-]dir     - directory grouping (directory < file)
		 [+-]gid     - group id (*nix only)
		 [+-]gname   - group name (*nix only)
		 [+-]mode    - file type derived from its mode (*nix only)
		 [+-]perms   - permissions string (*nix only)
		 [+-]uid     - owner id (*nix only)
		 [+-]uname   - owner name (*nix only)
		 [+-]nlinks  - number of hard links (*nix only)
		 [+-]size    - size
		 [+-]nitems  - number of items in a directory (zero for files)
		 [+-]groups  - groups extracted via regexps from 'sortgroups'
		 [+-]atime   - time accessed (e.g. read, executed)
		 [+-]ctime   - time changed (changes in metadata, e.g. mode)
		 [+-]mtime   - time modified (when file contents is changed)

	      Note: look for st_atime, st_ctime and st_mtime in "man  2	 stat"
	      for more information on time keys.

	      '+'  means ascending sort for this key, and '-' means descending
	      sort.

	      In case "name" ("iname" on Windows) is skipped, it will be added
	      at the end automatically.

	      Value  of	 the  option is checked to include default sorting key
	      (name on *nix, iname on Windows).	 When it is absent, the key is
	      appended to the value of the option.

	      Type  key	 is  somewhat  similar	in  this regard but it's added
	      implicitly: when "type" is not specified, sorting behaves as  if
	      it was the first key in the list.	 That's why if one wants sort-
	      ing algorithm to mix directories and  files,  "type"  should  be
	      appended to sorting option, for example like this:

		set sort+=type

	      or

		set sort=-size,type

	      Value  of	 the option is checked to include type key and default
	      sorting key (name on *nix, iname on Windows).  Here is what hap-
	      pens if one of them is missing:

		- type key is added at the beginning;

		- default key is added at the end;

	      all other keys are left untouched (at most they are moved).

	      This option also changes view columns according to primary sort-
	      ing key set, unless 'viewcolumns' option is not empty.

       'sortnumbers'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      scope: local
	      Natural sort of (version) numbers within text.

       'sortgroups'
	      type: string
	      default: ""
	      scope: local
	      Sets comma-separated list of  regular  expressions  to  use  for
	      group  sorting,  double comma is literal comma.  Each expression
	      should contain at least one group or its value will  be  consid-
	      ered  to	be  always  empty.   Only  first match of each regular
	      expression is considered.	 Groups are considered from  right  to
	      first  similar to 'sort', first group divides list of files into
	      sub-groups, each of which is sorted by the second group  and  so
	      on.

	      Example:
		set sortgroups=-(done|todo).*
	      this would put files with "-done" in their names above all files
	      with "-todo".

       'sortorder'
	      type: enumeration
	      default: ascending
	      Sets sort order for primary key: ascending, descending.

       'statusline' 'stl'
	      type: string
	      default: ""
	      Determines the content of the status line (the line right	 above
	      command-line).   Empty string means use same format like in pre-
	      vious versions.  Following macros are supported:

	      - %t - file name (considering value of the 'classify' option)

	      - %A - file attributes (permissions on  *nix  or	properties  on
		Windows) %u - user name or uid (if it cannot be resolved)

	      - %g - group name or gid (if it cannot be resolved)

	      - %s - file size in human readable format

	      - %E  - size of selected files in human readable format, same as
		%s when no files are selected, except that it will never  show
		size of ../ in visual mode, since it cannot be selected

	      - %d - file modification date (uses 'timefmt' option)

	      - all 'rulerformat' macros

	      Percent  sign  can  be followed by optional minimum field width.
	      Add '-' before minimum field width if you want field to be right
	      aligned.	Example:

		set statusline="  %t%= %A %10u:%-7g %15s %20d "

	      On  Windows file properties include next flags (upper case means
	      flag is on):
	       A - archive
	       H - hidden
	       I - content isn't indexed
	       R - readonly
	       S - system
	       C - compressed
	       D - directory
	       E - encrypted
	       P - reparse point (e.g. symbolic link)
	       Z - sparse file

       'syscalls'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      When disabled, vifm will rely on external applications  to  per-
	      form  file-system	 operations,  otherwise	 system calls are used
	      instead (much faster).  The feature is {EXPERIMENTAL} and {WORK-
	      IN-PROGRESS}.   The  option  will be eventually removed.	Mostly
	      *nix-like systems are affected.

       'tabstop' 'ts'
	      type: integer
	      default: value from curses library
	      Number of spaces that a Tab in the file counts for.

       'timefmt'
	      type: string
	      default: " %m/%d %H:%M"
	      Format of time in file list.  See "man 1 date" or "man  3	 strf-
	      time" for details.

       'timeoutlen' 'tm'
	      type: integer
	      default: 1000
	      The time in milliseconds that is waited for a mapped key in case
	      of already typed key sequence is ambiguous.

       'title'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true when title can be restored, false otherwise
	      When enabled title of the	 terminal  or  terminal	 multiplexer's
	      window is updated according to current location.

       'trash'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Use trash directory.  See "Trash directory" section below.

       'trashdir'
	      type: string
	      default: on *nix:
		       "%r/.vifm-Trash-%u,$VIFM/Trash,%r/.vifm-Trash"	or  if
	      $VIFM/Trash
		       doesn't exist
		       "%r/.vifm-Trash-%u,$XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm/Trash,%r/.vifm-
	      Trash"
		       on Windows:
		       "%r/.vifm-Trash,$XDG_DATA_HOME/vifm/Trash"
	      List of trash directory path specifications, separated with com-
	      mas.  Each list item either defines an absolute  path  to	 trash
	      directory	 or  a	path  relative to a mount point root when list
	      element starts with "%r/".  Value	 of  the  option  can  contain
	      environment  variables  (of  form	 "$envname"),  which  will  be
	      expanded (prepend $ with a slash to prevent  expansion).	 Envi-
	      ronment variables are expanded when the option is set.

	      On  *nix,	 if  element ends with "%u", the mark is replaced with
	      real user ID and permissions are set  so	that  only  that  only
	      owner is able to use it.
	      Note that even this setup is not completely secure when combined
	      with "%r/" and it's overall safer to keep files in  home	direc-
	      tory, but that implies cost of copying files between partitions.

	      When  new file gets cut (deleted) vifm traverses each element of
	      the option in the order of their appearance and uses first trash
	      directory	 that  it  was	able  to  create  or  that  is already
	      writable.

	      Default value tries to use trash directory per mount  point  and
	      falls back to ~/.vifm/Trash on failure.

	      Will  attempt to create the directory if it does not exist.  See
	      "Trash directory" section below.

       'tuioptions' 'to'
	      type: charset
	      default: "ps"
	      Each flag configures some aspect of TUI appearance.   The	 flags
	      are:
	      p - when included:
		*  file	 list  inside  a pane gets additional single character
	      padding on left and right sides;
		* quick view and view mode get single character padding.
	      s - when included, left and right borders (side  borders,	 hence
	      "s" character) are visible.

       'undolevels' 'ul'
	      type: integer
	      default: 100
	      Maximum  number  of  changes that can be undone.	Note that here
	      single file operation is used as a  unit,	 not  operation,  i.e.
	      deletion of 101 files will exceed default limit.

       'vicmd'
	      type: string
	      default: "vim"
	      The  actual command used to start vi.  Ampersand sign at the end
	      (regardless whether it's preceded by space or not)  means	 back-
	      grounding of command.

       'viewcolumns'
	      type: string
	      default: ""
	      scope: local
	      Format string containing list of columns in the view.  When this
	      option is empty view columns to show  are	 chosen	 automatically
	      using sorting keys (see 'sort') as a base.  Value of this option
	      is ignored if 'lsview' is set.  See "Column view" section	 below
	      for format description.

	      An  example  of  setting	the options for both panes (note vifm-
	      windo command):

		windo set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{size},11{perms}

       'vixcmd'
	      type: string
	      default: value of 'vicmd'
	      The command used to start vi when in X.  Ampersand sign  at  the
	      end  (regardless	whether	 it's  preceded by space or not) means
	      backgrounding of command.

       'vifminfo'
	      type: set
	      default: bookmarks,bmarks
	      Controls what will be saved in the $VIFM/vifminfo file.

		 bmarks	   - named bookmarks
		 bookmarks - marks, except special ones like '< and '>
		 tui	   - state of the user interface (sorting,  number  of
	      windows, quick
			     view state, active view)
		 dhistory  - directory history
		 state	   - file name and dot filters and terminal multiplex-
	      ers integration
			     state
		 cs	   - primary color scheme
		 savedirs  - save last visited directory (requires dhistory)
		 chistory  - command line history
		 shistory  - search history (/ and ? commands)
		 phistory  - prompt history
		 fhistory  - history of local filter (see description  of  the
	      "=" normal mode
			     command)
		 dirstack  - directory stack overwrites previous stack, unless
	      stack of
			     current session is empty
		 registers - registers content
		 options   - all options that can be set with the :set command
	      (obsolete)
		 filetypes - associated programs and viewers (obsolete)
		 commands   - user defined commands (see :command description)
	      (obsolete)

       'vimhelp'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      Use vim help format.

       'wildmenu' 'wmnu'
	      type: boolean
	      default: false
	      Controls whether possible matches of completion  will  be	 shown
	      above the command line.

       'wordchars'
	      type: string list
	      default:	"1-8,14-31,33-255" (that is all non-whitespace charac-
	      ters)
	      Specifies which characters in command-line mode should  be  con-
	      sidered  as  part of a word.  Value of the option is comma-sepa-
	      rated list of ranges.  If both endpoints of a range match,  sin-
	      gle  endpoint  is enough (e.g. "a" = "a-a").  Both endpoints are
	      inclusive.  There are two accepted forms: character representing
	      itself  or  number  encoding character according to ASCII table.
	      In case of ambiguous characters (dash, comma, digit) use numeric
	      form.   Accepted characters are in the range from 0 to 255.  Any
	      Unicode character with code greater than 255 is considered to be
	      part of a word.

	      The option affects Alt-D, Alt-B and Alt-F, but not Ctrl-W.  This
	      is intentionally to allow two use cases:

	       - Moving by WORDS and deletion by words.
	       - Moving by words and deletion by WORDS.

	      To get the latter use the following mapping:

		cnoremap <c-w> <a-b><a-d>

	      Also used for abbreviations.

       'wrap' type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Controls whether to wrap text in quick view.

       'wrapscan' 'ws'
	      type: boolean
	      default: true
	      Searches wrap around end of the list.

Mappings
       Since it's not easy to enter special characters there are several  spe-
       cial sequences that can be used in place of them.  They are:

       <cr>   Enter key.

       <esc>  Escape key.

       <space>
	      Space key.

       <lt>   Less-than character (<).

       <nop>  provides a way to disable a mapping (by mapping it to <nop>).

       <bs>   Backspace key (see key conflict description below).

       <tab> <s-tab>
	      Tabulation and Shift+Tabulation keys.

       <home> <end>
	      Home/End.

       <left> <right> <up> <down>
	      Arrow keys.

       <pageup> <pagedown>
	      PageUp/PageDown.

       <del> <delete>
	      Delete  key.   <del>  and	 <delete>  mean	 different  codes, but
	      <delete> is more common.

       <c-a>,<c-b>,...,<c-z>,<c-[>,<c->,<c-]>,<c-^>,<c-_>
	      Control + some key (see key conflict description below).

       <a-a>,<a-b>,...,<a-z>
	      <m-a>,<m-b>,...,<m-z> Alt + some key.

       <a-c-a>,<a-c-b>,...,<a-c-z>
	      <m-c-a>,<m-c-b>,...,<m-c-z> only for *nix
	      Alt + Ctrl + some key.

       <f0> - <f63>
	      Functional keys.

       <c-f1> - <c-f12>
	      only for MS-Windows
	      functional keys with Control key pressed.

       <a-f1> - <a-f12>
	      only for MS-Windows
	      functional keys with Alt key pressed.

       <s-f1> - <s-f12>
	      only for MS-Windows
	      functional keys with Shift key pressed.

       Note that due to the way terminals process their	 input,	 several  key-
       board keys might be mapped to single key code, for example:

	 - <cr> and <c-m>;

	 - <tab> and <c-i>;

	 - <c-h> and <bs>;

	 - etc.

       Most  of	 the  time  they  are defined consistenly and don't cause sur-
       prises, but <c-h> and <bs> are treated differently in  different	 envi-
       ronments (although they match each other all the time), that's why they
       correspond to different keys in vifm.  As a consequence, if you map <c-
       h> or <bs> be sure to map the other one to the same combination so that
       the mapping will work in all environments.

       vifm removes whitespace characters at the beginning  and	 end  of  com-
       mands.	That's	why  you  may want to use <space> at the end of rhs in
       mappings.  For example:

	 cmap <f1> man<space>

       will put "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the	 command  line
       mode.

Expression syntax
       Supported expressions is a subset of what VimL provides.

       Expression syntax summary, from least to most significant:

       expr1	  expr2 || expr2 ..	  logical OR

       expr2	  expr3 && expr3 ..	  logical AND

       expr3	  expr4 == expr4	  equal
		  expr4 != expr4	  not equal
		  expr4 >  expr4	  greater than
		  expr4 >= expr4	  greater than or equal
		  expr4 <  expr4	  smaller than
		  expr4 <= expr4	  smaller than or equal

       expr4	  expr5 . expr5 ..	  string concatenation

       expr5	  - expr5		  unary minus
		  + expr5		  unary plus
		  ! expr5		  logical NOT

       expr6	  number		  number constant
		  "string"		  string constant, \ is special
		  'string'		  string constant, ' is doubled
		  &option		  option value
		  $VAR			  environment variable
		  function(expr1, ...)	  function call

       ".." indicates that the operations in this level can be concatenated.

       expr1
       -----
       expr2 || expr1

       Arguments are converted to numbers before evaluation.

       Result is non-zero if at least one of arguments is non-zero.

       It's  right  associative	 and with short-circuiting, so sub-expressions
       are evaluated from left to right until result of	 whole	expression  is
       determined (i.e., until first non-zero) or end of the expression.

       expr2
       -----
       expr3 && expr2

       Arguments are converted to numbers before evaluation.

       Result is non-zero only if both arguments are non-zero.

       It's  right  associative	 and with short-circuiting, so sub-expressions
       are evaluated from left to right until result of	 whole	expression  is
       determined (i.e., until first zero) or end of the expression.

       expr3
       -----
       expr4 {cmp} expr4

       Compare	two  expr4  expressions,  resulting  in a 0 if it evaluates to
       false or 1 if it evaluates to true.

       equal		       ==
       not equal	       !=
       greater than	       >
       greater than or equal   >=
       smaller than	       <
       smaller than or equal   <=

       Examples:

	 'a' ==	 'a'	     == 1
	 'a' >	 'b'	     == 1
	 'a' ==	 'b'	     == 0
	 '2' >	 'b'	     == 0
	  2  >	 'b'	     == 1
	  2  >	 '1b'	     == 1
	  2  >	 '9b'	     == 0
	 -1  == -'1'	     == 1
	  0  ==	 '--1'	     == 1

       expr4
       -----
       expr5 . expr5 ..	    string concatenation

       Examples:

	 'a' . 'b'	     == 'ab'
	 'aaa' . '' . 'c'    == 'aaac'

       expr5
       -----

       - expr5		    unary minus
       + expr5		    unary plus
       ! expr5		    logical NOT

       For '-' the sign of the number is changed.
       For '+' the number is unchanged.
       For '!' non-zero becomes zero, zero becomes one.

       A String will be converted to a Number first.

       These operations can be repeated and mixed.  Examples:

	  --9		     == 9
	 ---9		     == -9
	  -+9		     == 9
	  !-9		     == 0
	  !''		     == 1
	 !'x'		     == 0
	  !!9		     == 1

       expr6
       -----

       number		    number constant
       -----

       Decimal number.	Examples:

	 0		     == 0
	 0000		     == 0
	 01		     == 1
	 123		     == 123
	 10000		     == 10000

       string
       ------
       "string"		    string constant

       Note that double quotes are used.

       A string constant accepts these special characters:
	 \b	 backspace <bs>
	 \e	 escape <esc>
	 \n	 newline
	 \r	 return <cr>
	 \t	 tab <tab>
	 \\	 backslash
	 \"	 double quote

       Examples:

	 "\"Hello,\tWorld!\""
	 "Hi,\nthere!"

       literal-string
       --------------
       'string'		    string constant

       Note that single quotes are used.

       This string is taken as it is.  No backslashes are removed  or  have  a
       special	meaning.   The only exception is that two quotes stand for one
       quote.

       Examples:

	 'All\slashes\are\saved.'
	 'This string contains doubled single quotes ''here'''

       option
       ------
       &option		     option value (local one is preferred, if  exists)
       &g:option	      global  option value &l:option		 local
       option value

       Examples:

	 echo 'Terminal size: '.&columns.'x'.&lines
	 if &columns > 100

       Any valid option name can be used here (note that "all" in  ":set  all"
       is a pseudo option).  See ":set options" section above.

       environment variable
       --------------------
       $VAR		     environment variable

       The  String value of any environment variable.  When it is not defined,
       the result is an empty string.

       Examples:

	 'This is my $PATH env: ' . $PATH
	 'vifmrc at ' . $MYVIFMRC . ' is used.'

       function call
       -------------
       function(expr1, ...)  function call

       See "Functions" section below.

       Examples:

	 "'" . filetype('.') . "'"
	 filetype('.') == 'reg'

Functions
       USAGE		   RESULT	 DESCRIPTION

       executable({expr})  Integer	 Checks whether {expr} command	avail-
       able.
       expand({expr})	   String	 Expands special keywords in {expr}.
       filetype({fnum})	   String	 Returns file type from position.
       getpanetype()	   String	 Returns type of current pane.
       has({property})	    Integer	   Checks  whether instance has {prop-
       erty}.
       layoutis({type})	   Integer	 Checks	 whether  layout  is  of  type
       {type}.
       paneisat({loc})	    Integer	   Checks  whether  current pane is at
       {loc}.
       system({command})   String	 Executes shell	 command  and  returns
       its output.

       executable({expr})

       If {expr} is absolute or relative path, checks whether path destination
       exists and refers to an executable, otherwise  checks  whether  command
       named  {expr}  is  present  in directories listed in $PATH.  Checks for
       various	executable  extensions	on  Windows.   Returns	boolean	 value
       describing result of the check.

       Example:

	 " use custom default viewer script if it's available and installed
	 " in predefined system directory, otherwise try to find it elsewhere
	 if executable('/usr/local/bin/defviewer')
	     fileview * /usr/local/bin/defviewer %c
	 else
	     if executable('defviewer')
		 fileview * defviewer %c
	     endif
	 endif

       expand({expr})

       Expands	environment variables and macros in {expr} just like it's done
       for command-line commands.  Returns a  string.	See  "Command  macros"
       section above.

       Examples:

	 " percent sign
	 :echo expand('%%')
	 " the last part of directory name of the other pane
	 :echo expand('%D:t')
	 " $PATH environment variable (same as `:echo $PATH`)
	 :echo expand('$PATH')

       filetype({fnum})

       The  result  is	a string, which represents file type and is one of the
       list:
	   exe	  executables
	   reg	  regular files
	   link	  symbolic links
	   dir	  directories
	   char	  character devices
	   block  block devices
	   fifo	  pipes
	   sock	  *nix domain sockets
	   ?	  unknown file type (should never appear)

       Parameter {fnum} can have following values:
	   - '.' to get type of file under the cursor in the active pane

       getpanetype()

       Retrieves string describing type of current pane.  Possible return val-
       ues:
	   regular	regular file listing of some directory
	   custom	custom file list (%u)
	   very-custom	very custom file list (%U)

       has({property})

       Allows  examining  internal  parameters from scripts to e.g. figure out
       environment in which application is running.  Returns 1 if property  is
       true/present, otherwise 0 is returned.  Currently the following proper-
       ties are supported (anything else will yield 0):
	   unix	 runs in *nix-like environment (including Cygwin)
	   win	 runs on Windows

       Usage example:

	 " skip user/group on Windows
	 if !has('win')
	     let $RIGHTS = '%10u:%-7g '
	 endif

	 execute 'set' 'statusline="  %t%= %A '.$RIGHTS.'%15E %20d  "'

       layoutis({type})

       Checks whether current interface layout is {type} or not, where	{type}
       can be:
	   only	   single-pane mode
	   split   double-pane mode (either vertical or horizon split)
	   vsplit  vertical split (left and right panes)
	   hsplit  horizontal split (top and bottom panes)

       Usage example:

	 " automatically split vertically before enabling preview
	 :nnoremap w :if layoutis('only') | vsplit | endif | view<cr>

       paneisat({loc})

       Checks whether position of active pane in current layout matches one of
       the following locations:
	   top	   pane reaches top border
	   bottom  pane reaches bottom border
	   left	   pane reaches left border
	   right   pane reaches right border

       system({command})

       Runs the command in shell and returns its output (joined standard  out-
       put  and	 standard error streams).  All trailing newline characters are
       stripped to allow easy appending	 to  command  output.	Ctrl-C	should
       interrupt the command.

       Usage example:

	 " command to enter .git/ directory of git-repository (when ran inside one)
	 command! cdgit :execute 'cd' system('git rev-parse --git-dir')

Menus and dialogs
       When  navigating	 to some path from a menu there is a difference in end
       location depending on whether path has trailing slash  or  not.	 Files
       normally	 don't have trailing slashes so "file/" won't work and one can
       only navigate to a file anyway.	On the	other  hand  with  directories
       there  are  two	options:  navigate to a directory or inside of it.  To
       allow both use cases, the first one is used on paths like "dir" and the
       second one for "dir/".

       General

       j, Ctrl-N - move down.
       k, Ctrl-P - move up.
       Enter, l - select and exit the menu.
       Ctrl-L - redraw the menu.

       Escape, Ctrl-C, ZZ, ZQ, q - quit.

       In all menus

       The following set of keys has the same meaning as in normal mode.

       Ctrl-B, Ctrl-F
       Ctrl-D, Ctrl-U
       Ctrl-E, Ctrl-Y
       /, ?
       n, N
       [count]G, [count]gg
       H, M, L
       zb, zt, zz

       zh - scroll menu items [count] characters to the right.
       zl - scroll menu items [count] characters to the left.
       zH - scroll menu items half of screen width characters to the right.
       zL - scroll menu items half of screen width characters to the left.

       : - enter command line mode for menus (currently only :exi[t], :q[uit],
       :x[it] and :{range} are supported).

       b - interpret content of the menu as list of paths and use it to create
       custom  view  in	 place	of previously active pane.  See "Custom views"
       section below.
       B - same as above, but creates unsorted view.

       v - load menu content into quickfix list of the editor (Vim  compatible
       by  assumption)	or  if	list  doesn't have separators after file names
       (colons) open each line as a file name.


       Below is description of additional commands and reaction	 on  selection
       in some menus and dialogs.

       if :cd command was used.

       Directory stack menu

       Selecting directory name will rotate stack to  put  selected  directory
       pair at the top of the stack.

       Filetype menu

       Commands from vifmrc or typed in command-line are displayed above empty
       line.  All commands below empty line are from .desktop files.

       Grep, find, locate, bookmarks and user menu with navigation (%M macro)

       gf - navigate  previously  active  view	to  currently  selected	 item.
       Leaves menu mode except for grep menu.  Pressing Enter key has the same
       effect.

       e - open selected path in the editor, stays in menu mode.

       Grep menu

       Selecting file (via Enter or l key) opens it in editor set  by  'vicmd'
       at  given  line	number.	  Menu	won't be closed automatically to allow
       viewing more than one result.

       See above for "gf" and "e" keys description.

       Command-line history menu

       Selecting an item will execute it as  command-line  command  or	search
       query.

       Volumes menu

       Item states:

       - * - checked flag.

       - X - means that it has different value for files in selection.

       - d (*nix only) - (only for execute flags) means u-x+X, g-x+X or	 o-x+X
	 argument  for the chmod program.  If you want to remove execute right
	 from all files, but preserve it  for  directories,  set  all  execute
	 flags to 'd' and check 'Set Recursively' flag.

Custom views
       Definition

       Normally	 file views contain list of files from a single directory, but
       sometimes it's useful to populate them with list of files that  do  not
       belong to the same directory, which is what custom views are for.

       Presentation

       Custom  views are still related to directory they were in before custom
       list was loaded.	 Path to that directory (original  directory)  can  be
       seen in the title of a custom view.

       Files in same directory have to be named differently, this doesn't hold
       for custom views thus seeing just file names might be rather confusing.
       In order to give an idea where files come from and when possible, rela-
       tive paths to original directory of the view  is	 displayed,  otherwise
       full path is used instead.

       Custom views normally don't contain any inexistent files.

       Navigation

       Custom  views  have  some  differences related to navigation in regular
       views.

       gf - acts similar to gf on symbolic links and navigates to the file  at
       its real
	    location.

       h, gh - return to the original directory.

       Opening ".." entry also causes return to the original directory.

       History

       Custom  list exists only while it's visible, once left one can't return
       to it, so there is no appearances of it in any history.

       Filters

       Only local filter affects content of the view.	This  is  intentional,
       presumably  if  one loads list, precisely that list should be displayed
       (except for inexistent paths, which are ignored).

       Search

       Although directory names are visible in listing, they are  not  search-
       able.   Only  file  names  are  taken into account (might be changed in
       future, searching whole lines seems quite reasonable).

       Sorting

       Contrary to search sorting by name works on whole visible part of  file
       path.

       Highlight

       Whole  file name is highlighted as one entity, even if there are direc-
       tory elements.

       Updates

       Reloads can occur, though they are not automatic	 due  to  files	 being
       scattered  among	 different  places.  On a reload, inexistent files are
       removed and meta-data of all other files is updated.

       Once custom view forgets about the file, it won't add it back  even  if
       it's created again.  So not seeing file previously affected by an oper-
       ation, which was undone is normal.

       Operations

       All operations that add files are  forbidden  for  custom  views.   For
       example,	 moving/copying/putting files into a custom view doesn't work,
       because it doesn't make much sense.

       On the other hand, operations that use files of	a  custom  view	 as  a
       source  (e.g. yanking, copying, moving file from custom view, deletion)
       and operations that modify names are all allowed.

Startup
       On startup vifm determines several variables that are used  during  the
       session.	 They are determined in the order they appear below.

       On  *nix	 systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.  On Windows
       systems vifm tries to find correct  home	 directory  in	the  following
       order:
	- $HOME variable;
	- $USERPROFILE variable (on Windows only);
	-  a  combination  of  $HOMEDRIVE  and $HOMEPATH variables (on Windows
       only).

       vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the fol-
       lowing places:
	- $VIFM variable;
	- parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
	- $HOME/.vifm directory;
	- $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only);
	- $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vifm directory;
	- $HOME/.config/vifm directory.

       vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following
       places:
	- $MYVIFMRC variable;
	- vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
	- $VIFM/vifmrc file.

Configure
       See "Startup" section above for the explanations	 on  $VIFM  and	 $MYV-
       IFMRC.

       The  vifmrc  file  contains  commands  that  will  be  executed on vifm
       startup.	 There are two such files: global and local.  Global one is at
       {prefix}/etc/vifm/vifmrc,  see  $MYVIFMRC  variable description for the
       search algorithm used to find local vifmrc.  Global  vifmrc  is	loaded
       before  the local one, so that the later one can redefine anything con-
       figured globally.

       Use vifmrc to set settings, mappings, filetypes etc.  To use multi line
       commands	 precede  each next line with a slash (whitespace before slash
       is ignored, but all spaces at the end of the  lines  are	 saved).   For
       example:

	 set
	     \smartcase

       equals "setsmartcase".  When

	 set<space here>
	     \ smartcase

       equals "set  smartcase".

       The  $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by
       hand to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that,  edit
       vifmrc  instead.	  You  can  control  what  settings  will  be saved in
       vifminfo by setting 'vifminfo' option.  Vifm always writes this file on
       exit  unless  'vifminfo'	 option is empty.  Marks, bookmarks, commands,
       histories, filetypes, fileviewers and registers in the file are	merged
       with vifm configuration (which has bigger priority).

       Generally,  runtime  configuration  has bigger priority during merging,
       but there are some exceptions:

	 - directory stack stored in the file is not overwritten unless	 some-
	   thing is changed in vifm session that performs merge;

	 - each	 mark  or  bookmark  is marked with a timestamp, so that newer
	   value is not overwritten by older one, thus no matter from where it
	   comes, the newer one wins.

       The  $VIFM/scripts  directory can contain shell scripts.	 vifm modifies
       its PATH environment variable to let user  run  those  scripts  without
       specifying  full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be
       added to PATH too.  Script in a subdirectory overlaps script  with  the
       same name in all its parent directories.

       The  $VIFM/colors/  and	{prefix}/etc/vifm/colors/  directories contain
       color schemes.  Available color schemes are searched in that order,  so
       on name conflict the one in $VIFM/colors/ wins.

       Each  color scheme should have ".vifm" extension.  This wasn't the case
       before and for this reason the following rules apply during lookup:

	 - if there is no file with .vifm extension,  all  regular  files  are
	   listed;

	 - otherwise  only  files  with	 .vifm	extension are listed (with the
	   extension being truncated).

Automatic FUSE mounts
       vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.	 It is
       implemented  using  file	 associations  mechanism.  To enable automated
       mounts, one needs to use a specially formated program line in  filetype
       or filextype commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

       1)  FUSE_MOUNT  This format should be used in case when all information
       needed for mounting all files of a particular type is the  same.	  E.g.
       mounting of tar files don't require any file specific options.

       Format line:
	 FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%FOREGROUND]

       Example filetype command:

	 :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

       2)  FUSE_MOUNT2 This format allows one to use specially formatted files
       to perform mounting and is useful for  mounting	remotes,  for  example
       remote file systems over ftp or ssh.

       Format line:
	 FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%FOREGROUND]

       Example filetype command:

	 :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR

       Example file content:

	 root@127.0.0.1:/

       All  %  macros  are  expanded by vifm at runtime and have the following
       meaning:
	 - %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file;
	 - %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which
       is created by vifm basing on the value of 'fusehome' option;
	 -  %PARAM  value  is filled from the first line of file (whole line),
       though in the future it can be changed to whole file content;
	 - %FOREGROUND means that you want to run mount command as  a  regular
       command	(required  to  be able to provide input for communication with
       mounter in interactive way).

       %FOREGROUND is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory,  but
       mount commands likely won't work without them.

       %CLEAR  is  obsolete name of %FOREGROUND, which is still supported, but
       might be removed in future.  Its use is discouraged.

       The mounted FUSE file systems will be automatically  unmounted  in  two
       cases:

	 - when vifm quits (with ZZ, :q, etc. or when killed by signal);

	 - when you explicitly leave mount point going up to its parent direc-
	   tory (with h, Enter on "../" or ":cd ..") and other pane is not  in
	   the same directory or its child directories.

View look
       vifm supports displaying of file list view in two different ways:

	 - in  a  table	 mode,	when  multiple columns can be set using 'view-
	   columns' option (see "Column view" section below for details);

	 - in a multicolumn list manner which looks almost like `ls  -x`  com-
	   mand output (see "ls-like view" section below for details).

       The  look is local for each view and can be chosen by changing value of
       the 'lsview' boolean option.

       Depending on view look some of keys change their meaning to allow  more
       natural cursor moving.  This concerns mainly h, j, k, l and other simi-
       lar navigation keys.

       Also some of options can be ignored if they don't affect view  display-
       ing in selected look.  For example value of 'viewcolumns' when 'lsview'
       is set.

ls-like view
       When this view look is enabled by setting 'lsview' option on, vifm will
       display	files  in  multiple columns.  Number of columns depends on the
       length of the longest file name present in  current  directory  of  the
       view.   Whole  file list is automatically reflowed on directory change,
       terminal or view resize.

       View looks close to output of `ls -x` command, so files are listed left
       to right in rows.

       In  this	 mode file manipulation commands (e.g. d) don't work line-wise
       like they do in Vim, since such operations would be uncommon  for  file
       manipulating  tasks.   Thus,  for  example, dd will remove only current
       file.

Column view
       View columns are described by a comma-separated list of column descrip-
       tions, each of which has the following format
	   [ '-' ] [ fw ( [ '.' tw ] | '%' ) ] '{' type '}' '.'{0,3}
       where fw stands for full width and tw stands for text width.

       So it basically consists of four parts:
	1. Optional alignment specifier
	2. Optional width specifier
	3. Mandatory column name
	4. Optional cropping specifier

       Alignment specifier

       It's  an	 optional  minus  or  asterisk sign as the first symbol of the
       string.

       Specifies type of text alignment within a column.  Three types are sup-
       ported:

       - left align

	   set viewcolumns=-{name}

       - right align (default)

	   set viewcolumns={name}

       - dynamic align

	 It's  like  left alignment, but when the text is bigger than the col-
	 umn, the alignment is made at the right (so the of part of the	 field
	 is always visible).

	   set viewcolumns=*{name}

       Width specifier

       It's  a	number	followed  by  a	 percent sign, two numbers (second one
       should be less than or equal to the first one) separated with a dot  or
       a single number.

       Specifies column width and its units. There are tree size types:

       - absolute size - column width is specified in characters

	   set viewcolumns=-100{name},20.15{ext}

	 results  in  two  columns  with  lengths of 100 and 20 and a reserved
	 space of five characters on the left of second column.

       - relative (percent) size - column width is specified  in  percents  of
	 view width

	   set viewcolumns=-80%{name},15%{ext},5%{mtime}

	 results  in three columns with lengths of 80/100, 15/100 and 5/100 of
	 view width.

       - auto size (default) - column width is automatically determined

	   set viewcolumns=-{name},{ext},{mtime}

	 results in three columns with length of  one  third  of  view	width.
	 There	is no size adjustment to content, since it will slow down ren-
	 dering.

       Columns of different sizing types can be	 freely	 mixed	in  one	 view.
       Though  sometimes  some	of columns can be seen partly or be completely
       invisible if there is not enough space to display them.

       Column name

       This is just a sort key surrounded with curly braces, e.g.

	 {name},{ext},{mtime}

       {name} and {iname} keys are the same and present both  for  consistency
       with 'sort' option.

       Empty  curly braces ({}) are replaced with the default secondary column
       for primary sort key. So after the next command view will be  displayed
       almost  as if 'viewcolumns' is empty, but adding ellipsis for long file
       names:

	 set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{}.

       Cropping specifier

       It's from one to three dots after closing curly brace in column format.

       Specifies type of text truncation if it	doesn't	 fit  in  the  column.
       Currently tree types are supported:

	 - truncation - text is truncated

	     set viewcolumns=-{name}.

	   results  in	truncation  of	names that are too long too fit in the
	   view.

	 - adding of ellipsis - ellipsis on the left or right are  added  when
	   needed

	     set viewcolumns=-{name}..

	   results  in	that  ellipsis	are  added at the end of too long file
	   names.

	 - none (default) - text can pass column boundaries

	     set viewcolumns=-{name}...,{ext}

	   results in that long file names can partially be written on the ext
	   column.

Color schemes
       The color schemes in vifm can be applied in two different ways:

	 - as the primary color scheme;

	 - as local to a pane color scheme.

       Both types are set using :colorscheme command, but of different forms:

	 - :colorscheme color_scheme_name - for the primary color scheme;

	 - :colorscheme color_scheme_name directory - for local color schemes.

       Look  of different parts of the TUI (Text User Interface) is determined
       in this way:

	 - Border, TopLineSel, TopLine, CmdLine, ErrorMsg, StatusLine, JobLine
	   and WildMenu are always determined by the primary color scheme;

	 - CurrLine,  Selected,	 Directory,  Link, BrokenLink, Socket, Device,
	   Executable, Fifo and Win are determined by primary color scheme and
	   a set of local color schemes, which can be empty.

       There might be a set of local color schemes because they are structured
       hierarchically according to file system structure. For example,	having
       the following piece of file system:

	 ~
	 `-- bin
	    |
	    `-- my

       Two color schemes:

	 # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin
	 highlight Win cterm=none ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
	 highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=red ctermbg=black

	 # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin_my
	 highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=green ctermbg=black

       And these three commands in the vifmrc file:

	 colorscheme Default
	 colorscheme for_bin ~/bin
	 colorscheme for_bin_my ~/bin/my

       File list will look in the following way for each level:

       - ~/ - Default color scheme
	 black background
	 cursor with blue background

       - ~/bin/ - mix of Default and for_bin color schemes
	 red background
	 cursor with black background and red foreground

       - ~/bin/my/ - mix of Default, for_bin and for_bin_my color schemes
	 red background
	 cursor with black background and green foreground

Trash directory
       vifm has support of trash directory, which is used as temporary storage
       for deleted files or files that were cut.  Using trash is controlled by
       the  'trash'  option,  and  exact  path	to  the	 trash can be set with
       'trashdir' option.  Trash directory in vifm differs  from  the  system-
       wide  one  by default, because of possible incompatibilities of storing
       deleted	files  among  different	 file  managers.   But	one  can   set
       'trashdir'  to  "~/.local/share/Trash" to use a "standard" trash direc-
       tory.

       There are two scenarios of using trash in vifm:

	 1. As a place for storing files that were  cut	 by  "d"  and  may  be
	    inserted to some other place in file system.

	 2. As a storage of files, that are deleted but not purged yet.

       The first scenario uses deletion ("d") operations to put files to trash
       and put ("p") operations to restore files from trash  directory.	  Note
       that  such operations move files to and from trash directory, which can
       be long term operations in  case	 of  different	partitions  or	remote
       drives mounted locally.

       The  second scenario uses deletion ("d") operations for moving files to
       trash directory and :empty command-line command to purge all previously
       deleted files.

       Deletion	 and  put  operations  depend on registers, which can point to
       files in trash directory.  Normally, there are no nonexistent files  in
       registers,  but	vifm  doesn't  keep track of modifications under trash
       directory, so one shouldn't expect value of registers to be  absolutely
       correct if trash directory was modified not by operation that are meant
       for it.	But this won't lead to any issues with operations, since  they
       ignore nonexistent files.

Client-Server
       vifm supports remote execution of command-line mode commands as well as
       remote changing of directories.	This is possible using	--remote  com-
       mand-line argument.

       To  execute  a command remotely combine --remote argument with -c <com-
       mand> or +<command>.  For example:

	 vifm --remote -c 'cd /'
	 vifm --remote '+cd /'

       To change directory not using command-line mode commands one can	 spec-
       ify paths right after --remote argument, like this:

	 vifm --remote /
	 vifm --remote ~
	 vifm --remote /usr/bin /tmp

       At  the	moment	there  is no way of specifying, which instance of vifm
       should arguments be sent.  The main purpose of --remote argument is  to
       provide support of using vifm as a single-instance application.

Plugin
       Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

       Commands:

	 :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
	 :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
	 :VsplitVifm  vertically  split	 buffer	 and select a file or files to
       open.
	 :DiffVifm   select a file or files to compare	to  the	 current  file
       with
		     :vert diffsplit.
	 :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

       Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right
       pane directory.	After arguments are checked, vifm process  is  spawned
       in  a  special "file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open them either
       by pressing l, i or Enter keys, or by running  :edit  command.	If  no
       files  are  selected,  file under the cursor is opened, otherwise whole
       selection is passed to the plugin and opened in vim.

       The plugin have only  two  settings.   It's  a  string  variable	 named
       g:vifm_term  to	let  user  specify  command  to	 run GUI terminal.  By
       default it's equal to 'xterm -e'.  And another  string  variable	 named
       g:vifm_exec,  which  equals  "vifm"  by	default	 and specifies path to
       vifm's executable.  To pass arguments  to  vifm	use  g:vifm_exec_args,
       which is empty by default.

       To  use	the  plugin  copy  the vifm.vim file to either the system wide
       vim/plugin directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

       If you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system  wide
       plugin directory add

       let loaded_vifm=1

       to your ~/.vimrc file.

Reserved
       The following command names are reserved and shouldn't be used for user
       commands.

	 g[lobal]
	 v[global]

ENVIRONMENT
       VIFM   Points to main configuration directory (usually ~/.vifm/).

       MYVIFMRC
	      Points to main configuration file (usually ~/.vifm/vifmrc).

       These environment variables are valid inside vifm and also can be  used
       to configure it by setting some of them before running vifm.

       When $MYVIFMRC isn't set, it's made as $VIFM/vifmrc (exception for Win-
       dows: vifmrc in the same directory as vifm.exe has higher priority than
       $VIFM/vifmrc).

       See "Startup" section above for more details.

       VIFM_FUSE_FILE
	      On  execution  of	 external commands this variable is set to the
	      full path of file used to initiate  FUSE	mount  of  the	closes
	      mount  point  from current pane directory up.  It's not set when
	      outside FUSE mount point.	 When vifm  is	used  inside  terminal
	      multiplexer,  it	tries to set this variable as well (it doesn't
	      work this way on its own).

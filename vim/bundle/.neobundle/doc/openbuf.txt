INTRODUCTION					*openbuf-introduction*

*openbuf* is a Vim script library to open and manage buffers.

Sometimes want to open a temporary buffer by plugin to show information or
want to write something.  And, you might want to reuse the window if the
opened buffer already exists.  However, a very troublesome and fixed
processing is necessary for this.
Moreover, there are a lot of methods for opening the buffer.  A work that
offers the user the ways of customizing this is bother.

This library provides the easy way for doing these.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.3 or later

Latest version:

==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*openbuf-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONSTANTS					*openbuf-constants*

g:openbuf#version				*g:openbuf#version*
	Version number of openbuf.  This is comparable.
	The version number is converted as follows: >
	0.2.0  =>   2000
	2.1.34 => 201034

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*openbuf-functions*

openbuf#new([{name_or_config} ...])		*openbuf#new()*
	Create a new |openbuf-object|.

	{name_or_config} is either {name} or {config}.

	{name} is String of the name of this openbuf.  If this is supplied,
	the created object is registered to the inner of library, and it can
	use by name.  See also |openbuf-object-name|.
	The config name is used by customizing.  See |openbuf-customizing|.
	This is usually the plugin name.
	If an object with {name} is already registered, update the config.
	This is completely replaced.

	{config} is a |Dictionary|.  See |openbuf-config| for detail.

openbuf#register({name}, {openbuf})		*openbuf#register()*
	Register {openbuf} that has already existed and return it.

openbuf#get([{name} [, {default}]])		*openbuf#get()*
	Return the openbuf object made by |openbuf#new()| beforehand.  Return
	{default} when an openbuf of the specified {name} was not defined.
	If {default} was omitted, return 0.
	When the argument is not given, return a dictionary that include all
	registered openbuf.

openbuf#execute_with({config}, {excmd})		*openbuf#execute_with()*
	Execute a {excmd} with {config}.  If the {excmd} uses openbuf
	internally, {config} is used.  See also |openbuf-config-priority|.



==============================================================================
OPENBUF OBJECT					*openbuf-object*

An openbuf object manage a group of buffers with buffer number.
There are two kinds of openbuf object.  It is unnamed object and registered
object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECT NAME					*openbuf-object-name*

The name of openbuf is important.  Because, this is used for customizing.
If you use this library with a plugin, it should write the object name in the
document.
The special name "_" is reserved for default of customizing.
See also |g:openbuf#config|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECT FUNCTIONS				*openbuf-object-functions*

openbuf.name()					*openbuf-object-name()*
	Get the name of this openbuf.  If this is an unnamed object, empty
	string is returned.

openbuf.open([{bufname_or_config} ...])		*openbuf-object-open()*
	Open a buffer.  If a reusable window exists, use it.
	If a buffer is newly created, 1 is returned.  Otherwise 0 is returned.
	The opened buffer is added to this openbuf for managing.
	See |openbuf-config-openres| about return value.

	{bufname_or_config} is either {bufname} or {config}.
	{bufname} is the buffer name.
	{config} is a |Dictionary| (|openbuf-config|).

openbuf.add({bufnr})				*openbuf-object-add()*
	Add a buffer to this for managing.  The buffer should exist.

openbuf.remove({bufnr})				*openbuf-object-remove()*
	Remove managed buffers from this.

openbuf.is_managed({bufnr})			*openbuf-object-is_managed()*
	If the specified {bufnr} is managed by this openbuf, return 1.

openbuf.list()					*openbuf-object-list()*
	Get the list of the buffer numbers that managed by this openbuf.

openbuf.config([{config}])			*openbuf-object-config()*
	Get the config of this openbuf.  If {config} argument is present, the
	config of this openbuf is replaced by it.  Update the acquired config
	directly when you want to update the config.

openbuf.gc()					*openbuf-object-gc()*
	Remove bufnrs that already doesn't exist from the management list.

openbuf.nearest([{tabpage}])			*openbuf-object-nearest()*
	Search the nearest managed buffer.  Return the position and buffer
	number by the form like [{tabpagenr}, {winnr}, {bufnr}].  If the
	{tabpage} argument is present and not zero, search current tabpage
	only.  If the buffer is not found, return empty list.

openbuf.do({cmd})				*openbuf-object-do()*
	Do ":execute {cmd} bufnr" for all managed buffers.  If {cmd} includes
	"%s", it is replaced by bufnr.
	Example: >
	call openbuf.do('bwipeout')

openbuf.is_registered()			*openbuf-object-is_registered()*
	If this openbuf is registered object, return 1.

openbuf.unregister()				*openbuf-object-unregister()*
	Switch to unnamed object.  Return myself for openbuf#unregister().


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECT FUNCTIONS WRAPPER		*openbuf-object-functions-wrapper*

The wrappers like openbuf#open() can be used for all functions of object.
All wrapper takes the {name} in the first argument.
The wrapper is performed like "openbuf#get({name}).open([{args}])".
If an openbuf of the specified {name} was not registered, a wrapper creates a
new one.



==============================================================================
CONFIG						*openbuf-config*

Each openbuf object has a config for itself.  A config is a |Dictionary|, It
has the following attributes.

bufname:					*openbuf-config-bufname*
	The name of opening buffer.
	This name is memorized in openbuf, and when the buffer of the same
	name is opened, the same buffer is opened.
	Therefore, it doesn't work well when the buffer name is changed.

reuse:						*openbuf-config-reuse*
	The rule of reuse of window.
	The buffer is opened there when there is a window where the buffer
	that has already been managed with this openbuf is opened.
	The rule is one of the following.
	"never":	Never reuse.
	"tabpage":	Reuse the window that is in the tab.
	"always":	Always reuse.
	The default value is "tabpage".

opener:						*openbuf-config-opener*
	The command(s) to open a new buffer.  If this value starts with "=",
	the value is treated as |expr|, and the result becomes the command(s).
	If the evaluation failed, the default value is used.
	Examples of commands:
	|:vertical|, |:leftabove|, |:rightbelow|, |:topleft|, |:botright|,
	|:edit|, |:split|, |:vsplit|, |:tabedit|
	The default value is "split".

openres:					*openbuf-config-openres*
	Specifies the result of |openbuf-object-open()|.
	"loaded":	Loaded the opened buffer this time?
	"newbuf":	Was the opened buffer newly created?
	"newwin":	Was the window newly opened?
	otherwise:	A dictionary with above all in member.
	The default value is "newwin".
	This can not be used by |g:openbuf#config|.

silent:						*openbuf-config-silent*
	When this is true, open the buffer with |:silent|.
	The default value is 0.

nomanage:					*openbuf-config-nomanage*
	Do not manage the buffers.  Use only opener.
	The default value is 0.

force:						*openbuf-config-force*
	A config is specified for this.  This is given to priority more than
	the user's customizing.
	This can not be used by |g:openbuf#config|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTION					*openbuf-config-function*

A function that has no argument can specify for any attributes.  In this case,
the return value of the function becomes the value of the attribute.  The
function can use "self" to refer to Openbuf.
This function is called every time the config is used.
Currently, the following functions use config.

- |openbuf-object-open()|

Note: The function doesn't have the argument in current version.  However,
this might be changed in future version.  Therefore, it might be good to make
the argument expandable by |...|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIORITY					*openbuf-config-priority*

The priority of config is as follows:

1. The openbuf object's "force" config.
2. The arguments of |openbuf#execute_with()|.
3. The arguments of |openbuf-object-open()|.
4. |g:openbuf#config|.
  a. {config-name}/{string}
  b. {config-name}
  c. "_"
5. The openbuf object's config.
6. The default config.



==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*openbuf-customizing*

|openbuf| can be customized by user.

g:openbuf#config				*g:openbuf#config*
	This ia a dictionary.  The key is basically a |openbuf-object-name|.
	The value is a |openbuf-config|.
	The key named "_" is used by all registered openbuf.
	The first part of the name delimited by "/" can be also specified for
	the key.
	For example, the config of key "plugname" is applied to all objects
	that start by "plugname/" and "plugname".
	In other words, the openbuf named "plugname/foo/bar" uses configs
	"plugname/foo/bar", "plugname/foo", "plugname", and "_"  by this
	order.



==============================================================================
EXAMPLES					*openbuf-examples*

>
	" Simple usage.
	call openbuf#open('myplugin')

	" With option.
	call openbuf#open('myplugin', {
	\    'bufname': '[myplugin buffer]',
	\    'reuse': 'always',
	\ })

	" OO Interface.
	let buf = openbuf#new('myplugin', {
	\    'bufname': '[myplugin buffer]',
	\    'reuse': 'always',
	\ })
	call buf.open()

	" Use unnamed object.
	let buf = openbuf#new()
	call buf.open('[myplugin buffer]')

Description~
	VCDE is a c++ development support by VJDE framework.

Future~
	Now, ctags file supported from two ways: 
	1. ruby parser, 
	2  readtags which come from ctag5.5.4
	Default , use readtags , Once the $VIM_RUNTIME/plugin/vjde/readtags is
not runnable for you OS, use following in your .vimrc to disable it. >
	let g:vjde_readtags=''
<
	Then, ruby parser will be used.
	Code completion in a gui window or a preview window for c++,simply
namespace and typedef support. >
	string str;
	str.find
		^<c-space>	
<
	Parameter preview in a window while your input a <C-space> after a 
'(' >
	string str;
	str.find_first_of(
			  ^<c-space>
<

	For quickly search the tag of c++ , you can generate a index for your
tags. Use the flowing command: >
	:call VjdeCppGenerateIdx()
<
	It's use |tags| parameter , then generate a index for each tag file,
named tags.vjde_idx
	NOTE: for *inux user, you must make sure that the director is writable
for the user.

	

Setup~
	To setup the completion for your own cpp files, you can set >
	g:vjde_cpp_exts
<
	which is seperated by ';' , It's treat as the extensions of c++/c
files , like >
	let g:vjde_cpp_exts='cpp;c;cxx;h;hpp;hxx'
<

Smart pointer support~
	Sometimes , We had use some smart pointer ,such as  >
	typedef auto_ptr<MyClass> MyClassPtr;
<
At that time , some coding support is read a MyClassPtr as auto_ptr, so , code
completion is not working correctly. So , add a file which is located : >
	~/.vim/vjde/ptr.lst
<
Add the following line: >
	auto_ptr
	std::auto_ptr
<
Then , code completion will treat MyClassPtr as MyClass. 

	
Other language Support ~
	NOTE: Just now, use <c-x><c-o> omni completion instead of this
function.
	VJDE support other language which is ctags supported.
	Once you want to use with your language, setup the variable >
	let g:vjde_ctags_exts='vim;rb'
<
	Then, the vim and ruby file can be previewed!

Global Variables~
g:vjde_max_deeps
	Search for member in Inheries . 
g:vjde_max_tags
	The tags number will be searched.

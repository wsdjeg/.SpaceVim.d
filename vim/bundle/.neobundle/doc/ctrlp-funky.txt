==============================================================================
COMMANDS					*ctrlp-funky-commands*

The basic command of |ctrlp-funky| is |:CtrlPFunky|. What you need to do is
just run this command in most of cases.

						*ctrlp-funky-:CtrlPFunky*
:CtrlPFunky [WORD]
	Extract lines from the currently edited file.
	You can provide an argument to the command. If it's provided, you 
	get lines that match the 'WORD': the argument will be entered into
	the CtrlP buffer by default.

It's useful to define mappings for this command. >

	nnoremap <Leader>f :CtrlPFunky<Cr>
	" Initialise list by a word under cursor
	nnoremap <Leader>u :execute 'CtrlPFunky ' . expand('<cword>')<Cr>
<

						*ctrlp-funky-:CtrlPFunkyClearCache*
:CtrlPFunkyClearCache
	This command deletes cache file for the current buffer.
	Note that this does nothing if |g:ctrlp_funky_use_cache| is set to 0.

						*ctrlp-funky-:CtrlPFunkyClearCacheAll*
:CtrlPFunkyClearCacheAll
	This command behaves the same as |:CtrlPFunkyClearCache|, but deletes
	all cache files.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS					*ctrlp-funky-settings*
You can customise the behaviour of |ctrlp-funky| using these variables.

					*'g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump'*
After the cursor has jumped to your wanted function line, what do you usually
tap before getting into real work? '|zo|', '|zx|', '|zx||zt|', or '|zv||zz|'
etc.  A valid action string consists of two parts:
    The first part can be one of  '|zx|', '|zv|', '|zo|' or '|zO|' for
    setting the fold view. If |foldenable| if off, then this part has no
    effect.  The second part can be one of '|zt|', '|zz|' for scrolling the
    screen.
Both of them can be '', which means nothing will be done.
The |g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump| can be a single string:
(default: 'zxzz')
>
       let g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump = 'zxzt'
<
which affects all filetypes, or it can be a |Dictionary| as follows:
>
       let g:ctrlp_funky_after_jump = {
            \ 'default' : 'zxzz',
            \ 'python'  : 'zO',
            \ 'cpp'     : 'zxzt',
            \ 'go'      : 'zz',
            \ 'vim'     : '',
       \ }
<
If you want to leave some 'margin' after 'z[tb]', see |scrolloff|.


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_multi_buffers'*
If this is enabled (=1), Funky searches function defs from all buffers.
So you can go back and forth in buffers using this functionality.
Note that this makes disabled |'g:ctrlp_funky_sort_by_mru'| as at 0.10.0.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_multi_buffers = 1
<

					*'g:ctrlp_funky_sort_by_mru'*
If this is enabled (=1), the list is sorted by MRU (most recently used).
In short, the most recently used function definition appears at the top of
the list.
Note that the MRU feature doesn't work persistently: If you delete
the buffer or once you quit Vim, the order of the list is reset to default.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_sort_by_mru = 1
<


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_syntax_highlight'*
If this is enabled (=1), the |syntax-highlighting| feature is enabled for the
CtrlP-buffer. It just sets |filetype| of the CtrlP-buffer to the same as the
current buffer.
(default: 0)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_syntax_highlight = 1
<


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_use_cache'*
If this is enabled (=1), the cache feature is enabled for the
CtrlP-buffer. In this case, if the file wasn't changed, funky loads function
definitions from cache, which is quicker.
Note that funky detects file changed by timestamp and file size.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_use_cache = 1
<


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_cache_dir'*
This may be set to specify a cache dir for |g:ctrlp_funky_use_cache|.
If not set, funky defaults to ~/.cache/ctrlp-funky (created if needed).


					*'g:ctrlp_funky_matchtype'*
This changes the matching algorithm used by |ctrlp|.vim. If you want 
matched chars to be highlighted, you may set this option to 'path'.
Note that this option changes the matching algorithm, so the filtered
result may be affected. 
Other possible values are 'tabs' and 'tabe', however, I don't think it's
useful setting these values.
(default: 'line')
(value: 'line', 'path', 'tabs', 'tabe')
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_matchtype = 'line'
<

					*'g:ctrlp_funky_nolim'*
This allows you to switch to no-limit mode. By default, the funky buffer is
not scrollable = limit mode.
(default: 0)
(value: 0 or 1)
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_nolim = 1
>

[sh]					*ctrlp-funky-sh*

bash, ksh, etc. You can specify Funky's internal filetype for 'sh'.
If this is set to 'dash', Funky treats 'sh' as 'dash'.
(default: 'bash')
>
	let g:ctrlp_funky_sh_type = 'ksh'
<

FILTER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE			*ctrlp-funky-filter-guide*
This section describes how to implement your own filter.
The internal API has been changed since |ctrlp-funky| version 0.6.0.
Therefore, if the filter uses the old API you may get an error.

						*ctrlp-funky-api-v0.6.0*
						*ctrlp-funky-create-own-filter*
The filetype filter must have an |autoload| function named 'filters'.
This 'filters' function must return a |List| which contains |Dictionaries|.
And each |Dictionary| must have 'pattern' and 'formatter' as keys.
NOTE: directory structure has been changed since v0.9.1.

This example is for 'vim'.
>
  function! ctrlp#funky#ft#vim#filters()
    let filters = [
          \ { 'pattern': '\m\C^[\t ]*function!\?[\t ]\+\S\+',
          \   'formatter': ['\m\C^[\t ]*', '', ''] }
    \ ]

    " You can highlight whatever in the |ctrlp|.vim window if you want
    call ctrlp#funky#highlight('^[\t ]*function[\t ]',
                             \ 'CtrlPFunkyVimFunc', 'Function')

    return filters
  endfunction
<
[Meaning of the filter's keys]
String	pattern~
  This is a regexp to extract function definitions.

List	formatter~
  |ctrlp-funky| formats each line that is extracted from the current buffer
  using the values of this item. Actually, these items are simply passed as
  arguments to the |substitute()| function.
  The sample function above removes leading whitespace.

CUSTOMIZING					*ref-man-customizing*

g:ref_man_cmd					*g:ref_man_cmd*
			Specifies the man command.  This allows a |List| that
			includes command and arguments.
			The default value is "man -Tutf8" if it is executable.
			Otherwise, it is "".  "-Tutf8" option is workaround
			for multi-byte environment.  The option might be
			unnecessary someday.
			Note: If you are a MacVim user, you may want to
			specify a dummy pager of man command with the
			following line in your ~/.vimrc. >
			let g:ref_man_cmd = "man -P cat"

			It is used for the value of $LANG when it is not empty

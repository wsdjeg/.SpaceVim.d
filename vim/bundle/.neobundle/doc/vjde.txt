								   *vjde-desc*
Desc~
Now , C++ supported with ruby and ctags. See |vcde| for detail.
Now , Csharp supported .

This tools wich is named "Vim Java Development Environment".
Current version, has two tools : Project and Auto Completion
Auto completion is available to :java ,jsp, taglib , html

Show Auto Completion in Preview window , and select or input in the 
Preview window, <M-d> is map to show doc of current In Preview window.
See |vjde_javadoc_path| for how to setup a java document path to be shown in
the preview window.

Require : ruby , rexml for ruby

the future list is:

Some plug-in is already used for Vim JDE~
a. Project File Plug-in           already 
b. match it
c. auto import                    ok
d. getter setter                  ok  
e. compiler

I will do:~

1. Project management	    ok 
2. Auto completion	    ok
3. Template		    ok
4. Extend tool
5. Implementing tool       ok
6. Getter/Setter            ok
7. To-do List                 ok, but don't committed


								*vjde-install*
Install~
    For Windows , for the document viewer , must copy plugin/vjde/wspawn.exe
to you path, such as JAVA_HOME/bin ...
								*vjde-project*
Project~
Project tools is used to save the VJDE variables, while you
change your variable,some command is useful to save and restore
the current settings.

Of course, you can add variable settings on the vimrc or anywhere 
the vim can be found.

Load project
 >
	:Vjdeload filename 
<Save project as  a new project >
        :Vjdeas filename 
<Save the current project >
        :Vjdesave 
<

Auto completion ~
							      *vjde-auto-comp*
For c++ or other ctags supported language , see |vcde|
Setup custom completion function  >
	:set cfu=VjdeCompletionFun
<
Setup classpath variable: >
	:let g:vjde_lib_path="lib/j2ee.jar:lib/struts.jar:build/classes"
<
								   *vjde-java*
Once you input something like : >
	String str;
	str.to<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
	System.out.println(str.to<CTR>-X<CTR>-U
        System.out.println(str.toUpperCase().<CTR>-X<CTR>-U
        return str.to<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
        new str.to<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
        ... [operator] str.to<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
        ... = str.to<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
< 
Package completion~
							       *vjde-java-pkg*
Completion for package and classes: >
	import java.<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
                    applet awt...
	import java.util.<CTRL>-X<CTRL>-U
                         Abstract...
<
In source Code : >
	java.util.<CTR>-x<CTRL>-u
                  Abstract..
<

Jsp file completion~
								    *vjde-jsp*	
the same as for jsp files >
        <%! 
	    str.to<CTRL>-x<CTRL>-u
        %>
        <%
	    str.to<CTRL>-x<CTRL>-u
        %>
        <%= session.get<CTRL>-x<CTRL>-u %>
<
        
Taglib completion ~
								 *vjde-taglib*
I add the taglib completion for jsp developer. 
Just now, completion with tld use xml-completion of |ft-xml-omni|.

For Example ,  I want to use completion for the following: >
        <c:<CTR>-X<CTR>-U
           out forEach...
        <c:o<CTR>-X<CTR>-U
           out
        <c:out <CTR>-X<CTR>-U
               value default ....
        <jsp:<CTR>-x<CTR>-u
             include useBean ....
           
<

At first , I had use this command : >
    :XMLns stl_c c
< See |XMLns| for detail of this command.
I had generate xmldata for STL taglib, use the following name: >
    stl_c 
    stl_sql
    stl_fn
    stl_fmt
    stl_x
<
You had to use you own prefix , For example , your coding is: >
    <%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/sql" prefix="sql"%>
< You should use following command: >
    :XMLns stl_sql sql
<
To generate your own taglib from the tld file , You can use the following
command. >
    :VjdeTld2Data <a TLD file> <name>
< TLD file is your own TLD file. Name is used to identify your xmldata. See
|xml-omni-datafile| for Detail. I will generate the file at 
$VJDE/autoload/xml/<name>.vim . 
NOTE: This function is |ruby| required.
								   *vjde-html*
Html auto completion :~
use it like: >
         <<CTR>-x<CTR>-u
           % %= ....
         <body <CTR>-x<CTR>-u
               bgcolor fgcolor....
         <body bgcolor=<CTR>-x<CTR>-u
                       aqua antiquewhit ....
         <body bgcolor="<CTR>-x<CTR>-u
                       aqua" antiquewhit" ....
<

Xml auto completion:~
						     *vjde-xmldata* *vjde-xml*
Use the system xml completion for xml . See |ft-xml-omni| .
Vjde Has a tool to generate the data file. >
	:VjdeDtd2Data <a dtd file> <name>
<
See |vjde-xmldata| for detail.
Note: This function is |ruby| required.
Xdoclet completion~
						 *vjde-xdoclet* *vjde-javadoc*
Xdoclet completion is used for xdoclet.
While coding comment ,use : >
	/**
	 * @<CTR>-x<CTR>-u
            author param return ... hibernate.class hibernate.subclass...
         * @hibernate.class <CTR>-x<CTR>-u
 	                    lazy ...  
	 * @hibernate.class lazy="<CTR>-x<CTR>-u
                                  true" false"
<
Default , xdoclet support javadoc only.
Add you own part , such as ejb.* ,hibernate.* to >
	~/.vim/vjde/xdoclet.def
<
while the xdoclet is enabled , automatically load the define from >
	~/.vim/vjde/xdoclet.def
<

file format is simple , line which is started / or * is treated as comment. >
	[private|public] enum BOOLEAN {
		value1,value2
	}
	public tag tagname < tagparent1,parent2 {
		attr [ATTRTYPE] attr1;
		attr attr2 {
			value1,value2
		}
		attr BOOLEAN attr3;
		....
	} 
<

	Note: once you change the xdoclet.def , backup is need for next time .
Update VJDE will recover it.

								    *vjde-doc*
Document viewer~
	When you preview your code completion in a gui window, for some
delays, the document of this function or member will be shown.
	It's depends on :
	g:vjde_javadoc_path   	'/javadocs/api/'
	g:vjde_doc_gui_height	 height of the window
	g:vjde_doc_gui_width	width of the window
	g:vjde_doc_delay	once a item selected ,delay how long.
				(1/1000 seconds) default 2000
	See |vjde-variable|
								  *vjde-iabbr*
Iabbr~
	Iabbr is some codelet,just something like :
		a while block, a for block ...
	use <c-j> to invoke this tools on gui running

	For example ,to use ruby with Iabbr

	Install your own iabbr as ~/.vim/vjde/ruby.iab
	setup g:vjde_iab_exts='rb'

	so , for your ruby file which is used '.rb' as the extend 
	
	Iabbr define file is |vjde-template|, and use the first '|' as the
cursor position.

Refactor~
	Note:Use g:vjde_utils_setup=0 to avoid command definition

								*vjde-preview*
Vjde Preview window~
	VJDE Preview window is a tool for preview in a gui tools for
selection.
	I had Use this window to preview the VJDE completion and code template
.
	In Java , html , It's use the completion cfu |cfu| to generate lines
to use. It's used like:  
NOTE:
	Preview.name ~
		name of the previewer , must equals the variable name;
	Preview.preview_buffer ~
 The buffer to be shown, It's the first line is
a description of content , like >
	java.lang.System:
<
or >
	java.lang.System:c 
	element->:
	body->attributes:
	bgground->values:
<
	Each line of the preview_buffer, the first word ( It's separated by a
space) is the type of the tag, the second word ( It's separated by ';' or '(')
it the tag name. All the other is trusted as comment. For example >
	java.io.PrintStream in;
	boolean equals(java.lang.Object);
	...
	element body;
	element html;
	....
<
	previewer.onSelect ~
		is called when use select a word in preview window. 
		Both GUI or Console preview are. It's has a parameter 
			which is the user selected word. 
	previewer.previewLinesFun ~
		It's be called with a parameter
	which is previewer self.  like >
	call previewer.PreviewLinesFun(self)
<
	previewer.docLineFun ~
		This function it's called to get the document preview window
line.  It's would return a String , which is comma separated. like >
		400;300;2000;java -cp vjde.jar vjde.completion.Document
	/mnt/win_e/downloads/docs/api/ src 
<
	It's used as :
	doc width ; doc height ; delay mills;command line to get document
	I will add preview.preview_buffer[0] and the
user selected tag name at the end of command line , and call it , trust the
stdout as the document which to be shown.

	previewer.CFU ~
		At first , It's call the |cfu| function to complete code
complation.
		Then , call previewer.previewLinesFun to get buffer would be
shown.
		Third , call preview.docLineFun get the docment define line 
		Third, call the previewer.Preview to preview.

		Four , call preview.onSelect to handle the user input.

	NOTE:See vjde_preview.vim for detail.
>
	
	let java_previewer = VjdePreviewWindow_New()
	let java_previewer.name = 'java_previewer'
	let java_previewer.onSelect='VjdeInsertWord'
	let java_previewer.previewLinesFun='GetJavaCompletionLines'
	let java_previewer.docLineFun='VjdeGetDocWindowLine'

	
	   au BufNewFile,BufRead,BufEnter *.java imap <buffer> <C-space> <Esc>:call java_previewer.CFU('<C-space>',1)<CR>a
<
	NOTE:you can put you preview content to preview buffer >
	call add(previewer.preview_buffer,'line1');
<
	

	Used for the code template: >

	let g:iab_previewer = VjdePreviewWindow_New()
	let g:iab_previewer.name='iab_previewer'
	let g:iab_previewer.onSelect='VjdePreviewIabSelect'
	let g:iab_previewer.previewLinesFun=''
	...
       	...
	call g:iab_previewer.Preview(0)
<
	See vjde_java_iab.vim for detail.
							       *vjde-refactor*
Variable refactoring~
normal mode:
	put your cursor on the variable , use the following command 
							      *vjde-rft-field*
>
	<Leader>rf
< 		change  current variable to member field. 
							      *vjde-rft-local*
>
	<Leader>rl
<		change  current variable as local variable.
								*vjde-rft-arg*
>
	<Leader>rp 
<		Add current variable as argument of method.

							      *vjde-rft-const*
Visula mode , a variable is selected ,only support 
String , char ,int ,long,double 
	select a number or a quoited String , >
	<Leader>rc
Make the current symbol as a private final static variable.
							      *vjde-fix-tools*
Vjde fix tools~
Fix tools is used for fix some minimal compile bugs. Now ,
unreported exception is supported
								 *vjde-fix-ex*
Vjde Exception fix is used for fix uncatched exception compile error 
For example  >
	java.net.URLConnection con= new java.net.URL("").openConnection();
<
Once compile the code of above, two exception is not catched. >
	:cc " move the cusor to current error line
	<leader>ff
<
	this line is change to : >
	try {
		java.net.URLConnection con ...
	}
	catch(UN... e1) {
	}
	catch(IOExce.. e5) {
	}
<
It's a simple and useful tools.

								 *vjde-fix-th*
This tools is fix unreported exception to function declaration,use throws on
function  to generate code .

								 *vjde-fix-im*
Automatically add import for Word under cursor. >
	<leader>ai
<


See |quickfix| for more compile support.


								   *vjde-code*
Code tools~
This tools for code generation .
							       *vjde-override*
Override the parents method. 
I the class  , execute : >
	:call Vjde_override(0)
<
list the class method , select the index of method, separated by comma or
space , then ,the code will generated on the end of class definition.

							     *vjde-implements*
Implements the methods of implements . >
	:call Vjde_override(1)
	<leader>oe
<
							     *vjde-impl-inner*
Implements interface with Anonymous class  . >
	:call VjdeImplementInner()
	<leader>ii
<
list the class method , select the index of method, separated by comma or
space , then ,the code will generated on the end of class definition.

							    *vjde-import-sort*
to sort the file imports lines , select the lines of import statement. >
	:call Vjde_sort_import()
	<leader>js
<
or >
	:[range]call Vjde_sort_import()
<
the lines : >
	import java.awt.*;
	import com.abc.*;
	import javax.applet.*;
	import java.io.*;
	import org.apache.*;
<
change to : >
	import java.awt.*;
	import java.io.*;

	import javax.applet.*;

	import org.apache.*;

	import com.abc.*
<

Extract import~
							 *vjde-import-extract*
This is a simple import tool. It's used to extract a import to define.
For example , a line: >
	javax.servlet.http.HttpSession session = reqeust.....
<
put the cursor on the work "HttpSession" , use a key >
        <Leader>je
<
the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession would be imported,  >
	import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
<
and this line become: >

	HttpSession session = request....
<

								 *vjde-wizard*
Wizard ~
Wizard is a tool template tools.
It's generated from a definition file and used by any language.
Default template file: 
Note:$VIM/vimfiles/plugin/vjde/tlds/java.vjde
Everyone can define a new template and use it.
Wizard engines generate any lines from the template. >
< Generate a class >
    :VjdeNclass
< Generate a class with a main >
    :VjdeNmain
< Generate a interface >
    :VjdeNinte
< Generate a property >
    :VjdeNprop
<
							       *vjde-template*
Template file~
    Template can be defined by you self. 
this is a simple description for template file.
a template is started by the following commands 
Define a template~
Definition a template started(^:the line of started): >
    template {templatename} [;template desc]
< 
Definition a parameter used by template( in a template , would zero or more  >
    parameter {parametername} [;parameter desc]
<
Definition a body of template ( followed by any text : >
    body
<
End of a template >
    endtemplate
<
Note:All of these worlds (template|temp , parameter|para , body, endtemplate|endt)
must at the beginning of a line.
Note: [;template desc] [;parameter desc] must started with a ';'

Template comment ~
the line is started with a '/' is comment : >
    //this is a comment 
    /this is a comment too
<
Would be ignored
And , the line which is started with '\' will be handled:
    remove the '\', leave all the following : >
    \//abc
< treated as '//abc' , is not a comment ; >
    \body
<treated as word 'body', not the body definition of above .


Template reference ~
Now , we say another two import element.
the  line is math following , treated as a template reference : >
    %AnthorTemplateName%
< Just like the entity of xml.
Well find the Template which named by "AnthorTemplateName" , and
insert the text of that template here.

Template Variable ~
    Template variable once defined , can be used in template body. >
    %{variablename}
<this pattern would be replaced by the value of variable which named "variable name"
or : >
    %{Time.now}
< Can be a ruby command can be resolved by ruby eval() function.
Once you have to have the String like : >
    %{notbetreatedasabove}
<
Can be writed as the following : >
    %{"%"}{notbetreatedasabove}
<

Note See $VIM/vimfiles/plugin/vjde/tlds/java.vjde , template JUnitCase for 
     a powerfull ussage.
						      *Vjdeinfo* *vjde-define*
Search Definition~
This tool is used to find a variable info or function define.
For example (both java and jsp file is available):
Show class information >
        System.out.println(....
           ^ place sursor here ,then execute:
        :Vjdei 
           the constructor,fields,methods, and inner class will be echoed.
<
Show  information of fields >
        System.out.println(....
                ^ place cursor here, then execute:
         :Vjdei 
        the field which is called "out" would be echoed. like:
               class : java.lang.System
               java.io.PrintWriter out;
<
Show information of methods >
         System.out.println(....
                       ^  cursor here
         the method which name is started with "println" will be echoed.
         like:
         class : java.io.PrintWriter
            public void print(bool);
            public void print(int);
            .....
         would be printed 
<
Show information of taglibs
for a tag definition >
          <c:out
              ^ place cursor here, then execute:
          :Vjdei
          the defination of tag out is printed as:
          <tag>\n<name>out</name>\n.....</tag>
<
For a tag attribute definition >
          <c:out value
                   ^ place cursor here, then execute:
          :Vjdei
          the defination of tag out is printed as:
          <attribute>\n<name>value</name>\n.....</attribute>

<

							  *Vjdegd* *vjde-goto*
Goto Declaration ~
	Goto the declaration of current works under cursor. It's search the
path for all source and goto the method or fields declaration. >
	:Vjdegd
<

							       *vjde-tasklist*
We can find something like "//TODO Add something here" is a task list;
This tool is used to search task in a file quickly.
Just a command: >
	:TDlist
<


							       *vjde-command*
command for normal mode:
<leader>\ai
	Add import under cursor
<leader>\oe
	extend some methods of class
<leader>\oi
	implements some interface of current class
<leader>\fr
	fix compiler errors with throws statement.
<leader>\ft
	fix compiler errors with try-catch statement
<leader>\jc
	generate constructor of class with all members.
<leader>\jt
	surround line with try-catch statement
<leader>\jd
	read the document of symbol that under cursor.
<leader>\jg
	generate getter-setter of current member.
<leader>\je
	add import for current line,it used for this line >
	java.io.PrintWriter
>
would add import statement and change this line to >
	PrintWriter 
<

<leader>\ep
	change current variable to function parameters.
<leader>\em
	chnage current variable to member of class.

command for visul mode:
<leader>\js
	sort the selected import statement.
<leader>\jt
	surround the selected lines with try-catch statement.
<leader>\en
	change the selected to a static const defination.

							       *vjde-variable*
Note:the define like : >
	g:vjde_show_paras [0|1]
<
is indicate: the global variable g:vjde_show_paras accept two values , 0 or 1.
the first is the default value.

								     *vjde-qa*
Note: Most of setting is auto command enabled .
see vjde.vim for detail.

    Q1. I had install this plugin, but , when I use <CTR>-x<CTR>-u, it said, not
found, why?
    A1. Check your |cfu| settings. "VjdeCompletionFun" is expected.

    Q2. I had used this tool for a java code completion, but I can't use it for jsp,
why?
    A2. Check your g:vjde_lib_path settings.The j2ee.jar or another is
include. like: >
    let g:vjde_lib_path="/home/me/lib/j2ee.jar:build/classes"
<
    Q3. I am MS Windows user, while I use <CTR>-x<CTR>-u, a command window is
occurred, how to avoid it?
    A3. You must use "javaw" instead of "java", use this command: >
    ruby $java_command="javaw"
<
    Q4. I am MS Windows user, I can't see the document , although the
g:vjde_javadoc_path is correctly.
    A3. Confirm the wspawn.exe is run enable from you command window.

   for 2.00.01 later version. use this command: >
    let g:vjde_java_command='javaw'
<
